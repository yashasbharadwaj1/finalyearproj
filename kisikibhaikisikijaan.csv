Of course Mrunal thakur as Sita mahalakshmi is imprinted in our hearts and that chemistry she had with DQ is so magical...I can't imagine anyone else as Ram & Sita apart from them Ô∏è

The consistency of pooja hedge in choosing disasters is a miracle,if anyone has any doubt if a film will succeed,ask pooja to read the script or hear the story and if she says No to that,it will be a hit,she rejected the role of Sita in Sita Ramam,so that says something

Salman's recent 'Filmfare' roast was more engaging and entertaining than his recent movies combined. I loved Bajrangi Bhaijaan though. He has INSANE crowd pull, highest among Indian actors. He can give movies that can break all records, only if he takes decisions with some critical thinking and treats people better but... Such potential wasted. N what's wrong with Pooja Hegde?

The problem with Pooja Hegde is that she prioritizes quantity (scale) over quality (script). She will blindly sign a film if the hero or director is big, the script is completely irrelevant to her. The good choice she made was with ""Most Eligible Bachelor"" but another part of me makes me think she did that just for Allu Aravind. If she wants to prove herself, she should choose good scripts, even if they're smaller films.

Bhai seems tired of giving one after another hit . He decided to change himself after giving back to back hits a few years ago . Even in Pathaan his energy seemed tiring compared to SRK. Seems like he's only working to maintain his brand value which has also gone down alot. Only TIGER 3 can be the saving grace for his career from here on. Quite sure it would take massive opening everywhere but will Bhai stop this cringe still ?

I think the potential of a film holds in its story line..and allowing actors to create an impact on the big debut. I have seen impactful performance of Siddharth Nigam in the film Dhoom 3..even though it was a small cameo.. still he nailed it like anything. Even Amir Khan sir quoted that it was his acting that caught his attention and ""I have to look him perform"" ..this was what he quoted. And if I look into performances like Aladdin , Ashoka, Siddharth has aced those characters.  Literally a film's writing should focus on all the characters or atleast allow the screen space so that a performer or in true sense artist can well express their true talent in the same. As said, "" to be a true artist one needs to live the film rather than act in it"" I respect your viewpoint on the movie. And really will continue being your fan listener ..who will listen to all your reviews..honestly I go to watch a film after ur consent

So it's clear salman has learned nothing from his previous mistakes e.g : dabang 3 , race 3 , radhe. He's definitely taking his stardom for granted and one day it might perish if he keeps on giving unnecessary favours to his talet less Friends.

Everyone knows what potential salman khan holds giving blockbuster movies like bajrangi bhaijaan, sultan, ek tha tiger, tiger zinda hai etc. Is not everyone's cup of tea but the problem is salman khan doesn't want himself only to deliver good films that's why in recent years he is collaborating with directors who has no direction for any movie and giving crap movies like race 3, radhe etc.

For a man of his size and stature, Salman Khan does good action. He should get back with directors like Ali Abbas Zafar and Kabir Khan and work with directors like Sidharth Anand, Neeraj Pandey, or some South Indian directors. At least those directors as writers produce some decent scripts.

It doesn‚Äôt matter to me now which movie Salman would starr in, in the upcoming times. The thing which bothers me the most about him is, his sloppiness/not putting any effort in his acts, which I have been watching in the last couple of films. The last movie where he had put a great effort was I feel it‚Äôs Sultan & to some extent, TZH. Since then whatever he‚Äôs come up with him being starred in is just complete lethargic work. Not only in films, if you could see his Biggboss hosting of 6/7 years back, it feels entertaining & the man is really into it. But now it feels like he‚Äôs there hosting just for the heck of it. Not interested in the business at all. Which is Sad!

Hi Jammy, can you complete your review of You season-4 Part-2, because you only did for Part-1, and seeing your Twitter you definitely had opinions regarding the second part as well. Another thing I wanted to ask was - which social media is your primary review medium, I see that you review a lot of movies and shows but only on Twitter, but we don't see them as full fledged videos. I was hoping you might do a review on Jubilee, since its made by Vikramaditya Motwane, but you made a video on Mismatched? Another thing I wanted to know whether is how do you chose which movies/shows to made videos on vs written Twitter thread review

As you have mentioned its just a decent flick nothing great about to remake it but the catch is being a festival season this might attract family audience, no glam or complexed or hard hitting story, just an average family entertainer.

Salman Khan, for long, was overconfident about him being a 'Brand' and everything he does, working. That was the case for so many years and baffled me, how he is loved despite some of his most cringeworthy movies (for me Ready is one of those) and bad acting , but I get he has a fan following who would take anything from him. But audiences have grown, they have more options to see good content. If someone like SRK (I am not a SRK fan) can fail why does he think he won't (at least SRK can act and has different expressions)? In fact some of the comments from his fans for the trailer shocked me, the trailer was cringe (and that is nicely put). I think it is his time now to again, do some sensible movies, not take any creative decisions, and work with good directors. If not, he may go SRK's route of having to take some years to come back with a bang. Without age-shaming, he is not in the time anymore where he can just do baseless movies. Is it only me- but the moment I knew it was directed by Farhad Samji I knew the fate of the movie.

Salman khan has realised he doesn't need to put in any effort into the story and plot. As long as he is there with action sequences he will earn the money.

I really had hoped things would change past Bajrangi bhaijaan and sultan. Those movies showed he can act and give us a good story. I am all for masala movies but i think it would be a stretch to call this one a masala movie.

Tamanah as a girl who hates violence was depicted well compared to this ....whatever this was moreover the styling of characters just annoys me like why does Salman have long hair as far as I know in veeram ajith was not a gangster or sth  and tamanah actually looked like she hated violence and was inclined towards simplicity in fact her whole family would be living in a simple house with simple principles here however everything is shown with grandeur which does not add up to their assigned personalities this movie just feels like another parody -a parody intended to mock us southies cus if they really wanted to remake a good film they could've gotten  a lot of choices but instead they chose this box office failure smh

Veeram isn't a great, spectacular script. It was a simple mass commercial entertainer which came during the festive times and targeted the family audiences, and after what seemed like an era, Ajith had stopped putting on tuxedos and guns and wore a veshti for the full length movie and showed a softer, funnier side to him.

Jammy, you saw the teaser, you saw the trailer, you critised them haveily and voice out concerns on the ability of farhad samji and also had a good laugh at the dialogues, it seemed like you really weren't expecting anything special or good from thsi movie. Then why did you even put the efforts to go watch the movie first day first show?

Even your overwhelming aspect explanation of the movie felt underwhelming, it's high time savlon bhai should face the reality for what it is rather than staying in denial, that he is almost 60 years old, & start doing age appropriate roles.

Movie's original is : Veeram . Correct but Salman Khan's remakes are mostly based on Tollywood ONLY. He made this after watching #Kaatamaraayudu not Veeram. That's why it's Jagapati Babu, Venkatesh, Bhoomika & Pooja Hegde.

Keeping the good and bad aspects aside jammy, i think the hooting in the theatre's answers the entire question on how the film is. No matter how cringe the dialogues are, moral of the story is that the MASS ENJOYED THIS MASS COMMERCIAL INSPITE OF THE FILM BEING A ONE TIME WATCH

I've lost all interest in Bollywood. They continue to cast 50-year-old male actors who are from my parents' generation with young female actors, which is disgusting. If he had a daughter, the actresses would be her age. Because of Bollywood's culture of nepotism, nothing will ever change. It is definitely declining because they simply act in their own interests and don't take the public's interests into consideration. Nothing new is created, just the same old action sequence and all. India will want to see more than what Bollywood currently has to offer as they become more educated.

More from this channel for you"
1,
2,
3,Pooja Hegde's ability to star in some of the worst movies of different languages is pretty impressive!!!
4,"The fact that Pooja Hegde rejected Sita Ramam still makes me wonder how she chooses her scripts 
Of course Mrunal thakur as Sita mahalakshmi is imprinted in our hearts and that chemistry she had with DQ is so magical...I can't imagine anyone else as Ram & Sita apart from them Ô∏è"
5,The intro was everything  and this whole movie can be a part of the ‚Äúmatlab kuch bhi‚Äù series
6,"SKF movie starter pack: 
- Remake 
- Bad director 
- Cringe dialogues "
7,Only Bhai can pull off any type cringe in Bollywood..like Balayya does for Tollywood 
8,"If this film is expected to have a weekend of more than 70-80cr, i can't even begin to imagine what the scenario will be during tiger3."
9,"I think it's time Salman works again with directors like Kabir Khan, Ali Abbas, directors who still have the creative liberty in making the film and not let Salman Khan's stardom run over the film"
10,Farhad Samji does not fail to disappoint. It's high time to worry about Hera Pheri 3 
11,I thank pooja hegde from the bottom of my heart for rejecting sitas role in sitaramam
12,You can't ignore bollywood but you can ignore legend Salman khan 
13,"The consistency of pooja hedge in choosing disasters is a miracle,if anyone has any doubt if a film will succeed,ask pooja to read the script or hear the story and if she says No to that,it will be a hit,she rejected the role of Sita in Sita Ramam,so that says something"
14,"4 Languages 
4 Flops 
Pooja hegde,the one who doesn't discriminate,no south,no north,jidhar star udhar get cast"
15,"Salman's recent 'Filmfare' roast was more engaging and entertaining than his recent movies combined. I loved Bajrangi Bhaijaan though. He has INSANE crowd pull, highest among Indian actors. He can give movies that can break all records, only if he takes decisions with some critical thinking and treats people better but... Such potential wasted. N what's wrong with Pooja Hegde?"
16,"The review of this movie made me recall the video ""Making of a Bhai movie"" by TVF that was released so many years ago. That video still holds true. One has to appreciate Bhai's consistency "
17,Who gives special claps for Pooja Hegde script selection 
18,"The problem with Pooja Hegde is that she prioritizes quantity (scale) over quality (script). She will blindly sign a film if the hero or director is big, the script is completely irrelevant to her. The good choice she made was with ""Most Eligible Bachelor"" but another part of me makes me think she did that just for Allu Aravind. If she wants to prove herself, she should choose good scripts, even if they're smaller films."
19,"Salman, in the first intro, delivers better dialouge with better acting than his own recent films"
20,Pooja Hegde and Jacqueline fighting rn for who has the worst film streaks
21,"Sigh! You know even if we want to defend Bollywood, it feels like that the hindi film industry has collectively decided to run itself into the ground. "
22,"After Lord Himesh ,I am stunned by Farhad's Samji's confidence of directing new level of cringe every time!!
No hopes from Hera Pheri 3"
23,Bhai seems tired of giving one after another hit . He decided to change himself after giving back to back hits a few years ago . Even in Pathaan his energy seemed tiring compared to SRK. Seems like he's only working to maintain his brand value which has also gone down alot. Only TIGER 3 can be the saving grace for his career from here on. Quite sure it would take massive opening everywhere but will Bhai stop this cringe still ?
24,"There is a scene towards the end of the movue (climax), where Salman is unconscious & again the whole neighbourhood starts to whisle to bring him back into consciousness.

But it wasn't only Salman who woke up after hearing thise whistles."
25,While I wasn't the biggest fan of veeram I did feel that the writing of it felt very grounded and also that I found myself genuinely caring for ajith's character.. and liked the relationship that was shown between him and his brothers.
26,I'm waiting for RRKPK I hope this film does not disappoint us  I am excited for Ranveer and Alia
27,"Am in awe of your patience as a reviewer who has to undergo these kind of  traumatic experience ,in order to deliver the YouTube experience which you have promised for your dear subscribers. . Keep it up bro..."
28,"I think the potential of a film holds in its story line..and allowing actors to create an impact on the big debut. I have seen impactful performance of Siddharth Nigam in the film Dhoom 3..even though it was a small cameo.. still he nailed it like anything. Even Amir Khan sir quoted that it was his acting that caught his attention and ""I have to look him perform"" ..this was what he quoted. And if I look into performances like Aladdin , Ashoka, Siddharth has aced those characters.  Literally a film's writing should focus on all the characters or atleast allow the screen space so that a performer or in true sense artist can well express their true talent in the same. As said, "" to be a true artist one needs to live the film rather than act in it"" I respect your viewpoint on the movie. And really will continue being your fan listener ..who will listen to all your reviews..honestly I go to watch a film after ur consent"
29,"I think the creators like you deserve more support, so people must subscribe to you so that we can get more reviewers like you and less brainless criticism from other channels. Good work, Jammy!"
30,"So it's clear salman has learned nothing from his previous mistakes e.g : dabang 3 , race 3 , radhe. He's definitely taking his stardom for granted and one day it might perish if he keeps on giving unnecessary favours to his talet less Friends."
31,"I feel so bad for Siddharth, Raghav and Jassie (the three brothers), they had such a forgettable debut. Hope the bad luck doesn't follow them for their next ventures."
32,"Everyone knows what potential salman khan holds giving blockbuster movies like bajrangi bhaijaan, sultan, ek tha tiger, tiger zinda hai etc. Is not everyone's cup of tea but the problem is salman khan doesn't want himself only to deliver good films that's why in recent years he is collaborating with directors who has no direction for any movie and giving crap movies like race 3, radhe etc."
33,"Everyone knew the result before it even released
Ps: I'm a salman fan but the name FARHAD NOLAN SAMJI is enough to ruin everything"
34,"Satish kaushik ji is a gem
Rest in peace legend"
35,"Now waiting for Hera pheri 3 by Farhad Nolan samji  
The whole Bollywood industry need Revolution or reboot from basic to advance level 
They literally stopped caring "
36,"If the ""good"" regarding a movie starts with a cameo , then there is nothing more to be said"
37,"""Iss desh mein hai bada dum, Vande Mataram"" is an old tweet of bhai. Now bhai's tweets are becoming dialogues. Legend"
38,Literally scratching my head figuring out how in the hell Pooja Hegde has managed the highest number of 100cr grossers as a lead actress since her debut.
39,Still his stardom is so much that Tiger3 will be blockbuster. But the real problem here is Hera Pheri by Farhad Samji
40,"I am not able to recall, when I watched Bhai's movie in theatre last time. I think Bajrangi Bhaijaan was the last good movie of Bhaijaan which was worth watching in theatre. Uske baad bhai suffered from bimari of over confidence"
41,"As always, thank you for taking one for the team Nobody should be subjected to this torture."
42,The fact that Pooja Hegde rejected Pushpa still makes us wonder about her script choosing......
43,Let's leave a Like of respect for Farhad Nolan Samji. The creator who keeps on giving such movies.
44,"""All our dreams can come true if we have the courage to pursue them."" _Walt Disney"
45,"i dont know how people just decide to make remakes, like they should see if the audience received it well or maybe if it would work out for the hindi audience. there are some movies that with even a lot of tuning will not suit certain audiences. i hope they realise this and take better decisions in the future. some movies dont require remakes also, like in the case of ala vaikuntapurramlo, im not sure what they were thinking when they went ahead with that decision.."
46,"As a tamizhan, i predicted how the movie would be just by the trailer. Success of veeram was that it was much grounded, attracted village audiences too. Here they made everything grandier, modern . Almost all the scenes look funny to me"
47,Veeram was really engaging and a fun watch. It wasn‚Äôt exceptional movie nor a masterpiece but a fun watch with family. It wasn‚Äôt cringe but this ‚Ä¶..
48,Salman khan‚Äôs films in the future are looking way better with films like tiger 3 and pavan putra bhaijaan which I think will bring him back with big blockbusters.
49,I would love to see you review the Malayalam film ‚ÄúSpadikam‚Äù. It stars Mohanlal and Thilakan in the main roles.
50,I am convinced that hera pheri 3 will be a black spot in the series.
51,"Bro Watch Telugu film Virupaksha,got good reviews . A mystery thriller with Horror elements . Not perfect but a very good watch .This should be watched in Theatres only , had best theatre experience in recent times"
52,"Totally did not expect this  said no one => this is the best example when actor overpowers the director to the point he‚Äôs controlling everything then this is the khichdi you get, I don‚Äôt think salman even takes suggestions from his father anymore Ô∏è"
53,"Iam Huge Fan & Supporter Of Mass Genre Because It Is Made By Indians Our Own Uniqueness No One In The World Can Combine Multi Genre Andre Make Movie Like Indian Cinema & also It Is The Genre Where It Can Connect To The Mass But It Should Be Made Good With Good & Engaging Script Poetic - Punching Dailouge , Beautiful Songs & Love Story Great Action Scenes , Good Acting  Best Example of Mass Cinema In Hindi Cinema In Recent Time Are  -"
54,"Pooja hegde going through the same bollywood run Tamanna and Kriti kharbanda went through, the only difference is that she's going way beyond in every industry"
55,"F for respect to jammy for enduring this torture in the name of a movie.
This how villains are made."
56,Farhad Samji never disappoint..
57,"Ajit and Vijay movies are only for certain non-serious moods and strictly for fans. Strictly not for hardcore movie fans. 
Just like you Jammy, we are also scatching our heads on why these are being remade!"
58,"For a man of his size and stature, Salman Khan does good action. He should get back with directors like Ali Abbas Zafar and Kabir Khan and work with directors like Sidharth Anand, Neeraj Pandey, or some South Indian directors. At least those directors as writers produce some decent scripts."
59,"brother i couldnt stop laughing all throughout the movie i  was genuinely crying throughout it wondering why me and my friends spent 290 on a ticket and it was justified by the choreo, weird vande mataram one liners and us trying to hoot and cheer for salmaan"
60,"Casting so many newcomers who do not know the A of Acting was a bad decision for a film as big as this. 
Salman should have kept himself in focus and selected a story and director which would suit his comeback just like SRK did with Pathaan."
61,"Bhaijan on Eid means Families will come but after seeing Farhad Samji as Director, many will surely avoid. It would have been better to release Tiger 3 befor this as the hype for Spy Universe is far greater"
62,"My respect for Pooja hegde after knowing she turned down sita mahalaxmi's role:

Couldn't imagine anyone but Mrunal thakur as Sita"
63,"Virupaksha, a Telugu horror thriller got released today and is garnering positive reviews from Audience. Hoping that you will get chance to see the movie."
64,We need a film by Salman & Govinda and directed by Samji. Imagine the level of cringe 
65,Hello Jammy. Lots of Love from Sri Lanka. Can you please do a video on how Salman proved all critics wrong with KBKJ? We would love to see your reaction on the movie getting close to 80% growth in collections despite negativity and hatred. This is a kind request. Thank you so much!
66,"The myth of the man is bigger than the man himself now. 
The braclet, being human, jokes about not having settled down. It's like Bhaicinematic Universe. Also Pooja Hegde despite being a capable actor chooses the randomest of scripts. "
67,"Never disappoints in Disappointing
- Pooja Hegde
Seriously giving strong competition to Uravashi Rautela The GOAT"
68,What can you expect from Tamil remakes like Jigarthanda and Veeram
69,"Salman Khan is like small kid, if he get some teacher which isn't strict and don't give shit, Salman is on autopilot mode without ADAS activated and then collides with audience.
On contrary if director is serious about the movie and pampering it like newborn, Salman outright shines. Just see Tere Naam, Tiger, BajBhai, Sultan"
70,Raghav was giving an interview and talking so much about his learning in acting‚Ä¶.and this is what he did 
71,The fact that he made Nirjara (bhumika) his mother is Crazy! She is Literally younger. And he casts this 21y/o as the heroine bro is like 60 himself
72,I sincerely hope that the box office numbers of this movie make it clear to Salman that such half-assed attempts to remake already mediocre movies are not going to work!!
73,"you should have covered ""Chengiz"" from Bengal. It would mean a great deal, if there can be a video on your channel on this film. It will reach a great deal of audience."
74,Imagine Balayya and Salman Khan in a movie...nothing can top that ig 
75,"Kisi ka troll kisi ki meme, a nice Eid gift "
76,Fun fact whole film was actually shot in bhaijaans farmhouse  he did the work during his leisure time 
77,Selmons entry scene wearing a jacket in the Air i don't know where our Indian directors get ideas from #Ripcinema  this movie deserves Oscar
78,"Hi Jammy, waiting for your review on Bengali Pan Indian movie Chengiz starting Jeet.. story  and screenplay is written by NEERAJ PANDEY who‚Äôs on a hot run after Special Ops and Khakhee The Bihar Story.."
79,"Hey Jammy, pls make a video on how Bollywood movies Stereotype others cultures . I  guess this could even make a segment of series"
80,Veeram is the best movie that came out from siva-ajith combo. Veeram is also one of the best movies from Ajith Kumar in the last decade
81,I was more shocked that sidharth Nigam choose to do this movie than Salman because he is the only one who you can call a proper talented actor in whole cast
82,"It doesn‚Äôt matter to me now which movie Salman would starr in, in the upcoming times. The thing which bothers me the most about him is, his sloppiness/not putting any effort in his acts, which I have been watching in the last couple of films. The last movie where he had put a great effort was I feel it‚Äôs Sultan & to some extent, TZH. Since then whatever he‚Äôs come up with him being starred in is just complete lethargic work. Not only in films, if you could see his Biggboss hosting of 6/7 years back, it feels entertaining & the man is really into it. But now it feels like he‚Äôs there hosting just for the heck of it. Not interested in the business at all. Which is Sad!"
83,"Perfect mass masala festival movie 
Paisa vasool, sureshot box office bang salmania show "
84,Intresting thing about Salman movies is that u can already make a review video before watching it because we know how it will turnout
85,"You'll laugh in serious moments and Will sit with a poker face in funny moments. That's Farhad Samji, folks "
86,"And with that goes my all hopes for hera pheri 3. If he really is making it, then we shall never even talk about it!!"
87,When the first good aspect of the movie is the cameo I could tacitly understand the quality of the  movie
88,Jammy you were way  generous in giving the review when you said lets discuss the good and the bad. I was like THE GOOD
89,Hats off to you for watching this movie & really appreciate your patience for watching till the end.
90,"I always feel that Salman is balakrishna of Bollywood . Many of my friends also think so .Their acting prowess , their over the top action , their selection of non sensical scripts, maybe Salman is somewhat better atleast he tries to maintain his body . Btw we are from Andhra Pradesh."
91,"IMPO, the train set pieces in Veeram was way better than this one's metro set pieces.The train set pieces was still perfectly executed and captured.
Also, Ajith with that salty look was way better than Salman's hairstyle.That's why I like actors that don't use de aging technology.(that also includes actors like Mohanlal also during his Tamil and Telugu ventures)."
92,In one of Farhad Samjis recent interviews he used Bhool Bhulaiya and Housefull 4 box office collections justifying his strength as a director. Let's please not give him the pleasure this time. Maybe if it flops Hera pheri makers might take a step back. Being mediocre is one thing. But being arrogant about it really grinds my gears.
93,Pooja hegde has yet again cemented her position of being the lucky charm in every movie. Palak tiwari and shehnaz gill's career is over before it got started...
94,"I think 'Jubilee' deserves a review asap, there's just too much to know your take on in that series,,Please do it!!"
95,The fact that Pooja Hegde rejected Sita Ramam makes me wonder why she chooses bad scripts and why she is getting typecast as the heroine who romances the hero. It's time that Pooja have to be careful while choosing her scripts and she needs to play different roles instead of always playing the hero's love interest.
96,"Remember you mentioning it in quite some videos that Salman does look good if there's effort, Bajrangi Bhaijaan being prime example. 
Tiger 3 will break the roof, but what about the 3-4 mediocre projects in between/after it"
97,"Also, the sets in this movie are artificially spotless and flawless (as compared to Veeram)."
98,Please watch Jaya Jaanaki Nayaka only for the potrayal and characterisation of the villian(Jagapathi Babu). He was badass in the film..
99,"Vijendar, BB Contestant Shenaj and raghav were COMPITING with each other to prove who is most terrible Actor  and the winner is...."
100,"Was waiting for your review 
This film made me cry blood through eye"
101,"If u literally cast 'vijender singh' and barely shoot action, u must be a genius"
102,Actually Akshay Kumar casted for  KBKJ but later Salman Khan made it ......
103,Entry part is far better then whole movie
104,i dont know it u noticed but when pooja arrives there is a bgm of bbbbbbb bhabhi bbbbbb bhabhi it was insane
105,The thing is this film's frames and art works looks like an ad. For example that dining table song (I forgot the name of the song ) and all inside house shots. Those look like an ad. I don't know where went wrong 
106,"Also Jammy, need your thoughts on the recent rehashed teaser of Adipurush released for the Tribeca film festival, with better color grade and some animation shots as well."
107,Farhad samji never disappoints in disappointing
108,The entire movie itself is a problem but while selecting for an actress to portray a telugu girl I wish they had selected somebody of  telugu origin
109,"Last night me and my brother were discussing about how bad recent Salman film's were. He didn't know his acting prowess of early 2k movies, so I made him watch Kyon Ki... and we both were weeping at the end. It's high time Salman re-work with directors like Priyadarshan who don't let star Salman overshadow actor Salman and control the creative process."
110,I am so happy what i was thinking came true .. i hope this will make him stop cringe movies or no movies at all
111,"Salman Khan should start taking critics seriously, because now his films are doing badly at BO."
112,And now I am more scared for HP3!! They have chosen one person who can easily destroy it!!
113,"We as an audience like it, it's full of entertainment, "
114,Mohenjo Daro to Beast To Cirkus to KBKJ. POOJA Hedge take a bow 
115,Thanks Jammy for this quick recap .....covers everything 
116,"You put a video on announcements from South movies - Vikram -Ranjith's Thangalaan, Malaikottai Vaaliban by LJP,  Bazooka by Mammootty, high budgeted Kanguva by Siva, Pawan Kalyan's OG by Sujeeth and which Shankar project are you most excited for-Game Changer or Indian 2?Is Ram Charan really spiralling down in his career post RRR? About NTR30 also.These announcements from South are more than enough for your content.TBH, My excitement for Game Changer is down only because of the writer that is the director of KKBKKJ also."
117,I want the dabaang 1 salman back. So much class and wit in how he would say his dialogues
118,"We should soon start a campaign for Hera Pheri 3 for kicking Nolan Samji out of the project. Otherwise, our entire childhood is really in danger."
119,Let's call a spade a spade and just admit we all knew this was a B-grade film from the trailer & songs
120,Waiting for my dream film written by farhad samji.. directed by Milan zaveri staring tiger shroff
121,"I still remember when veeram released, as an Ajith fan I expected the worst, but the movie was good. Good at its best, I had great time watching it(fanboy thing). But I can‚Äôt really understand why it was remade in Telugu as well as Hindi "
122,Trivia - Bhumika Chawla who plays Bhoi‚Äôs sister in law played Bhoi‚Äôs heroine in Tere Naam back in 2003.
123,"Hello Jammy. Please review Telugu movie Virupaksha that has released today.

It is written by Sukumar and directed by his assistant Karthik Dandu starring Sai Dharam Tej and Samyuktha Menon.."
124,The fact that 'the underwhelming aspects' of the video is longer that 'the good' sums up everything for you 
125,"Hi Jammy, can you complete your review of You season-4 Part-2, because you only did for Part-1, and seeing your Twitter you definitely had opinions regarding the second part as well. Another thing I wanted to ask was - which social media is your primary review medium, I see that you review a lot of movies and shows but only on Twitter, but we don't see them as full fledged videos. I was hoping you might do a review on Jubilee, since its made by Vikramaditya Motwane, but you made a video on Mismatched? Another thing I wanted to know whether is how do you chose which movies/shows to made videos on vs written Twitter thread review"
126,Thanks Jammy for saving my weekend‚Ä¶ was thinking of going to watch it .. I am a huge Salman Khan fan but geezzz Idk what‚Äôs made him come up with this one ‚Ä¶
127,"Viram was a super hit movie, pulling more than a 100 crore on a 30+ crore budget"
128,"Is it possible to make A good Motion capture film in India like Avatar bcoz we got Adipursh and Kochadiyaan made with same technology. 
Lady Super star Anushka shetty next film ""Kathanaar"" is going to be made with same technology is it possible"
129,Hey Anmol. Are you planning to review 'Jubilee' ? I was kind of waiting for it. 
130,Finally the most awaited review 
131,I wish Salman Khan again gets a script like Bajrangi Bhaijaan...
132,jammy u need to watch the series Jubilee. It's one of those masterpieces for sure!!
133,"As you have mentioned its just a decent flick nothing great about to remake it but the catch is being a festival season this might attract family audience, no glam or complexed or hard hitting story, just an average family entertainer."
134,"Amazing review brother
To the point and very precise.
You saved my money bro"
135,"Hi Jammy please watch and review ""Virupaksha"" from Telugu film Industry. It got huge positive response from Telugu audience and critics, one of the best in the recent times . I think you will definitely love it"
136,"Salman Khan, for long, was overconfident about him being a 'Brand' and everything he does, working. That was the case for so many years and baffled me, how he is loved despite some of his most cringeworthy movies (for me Ready is one of those) and bad acting , but I get he has a fan following who would take anything from him. But audiences have grown, they have more options to see good content. If someone like SRK (I am not a SRK fan) can fail why does he think he won't (at least SRK can act and has different expressions)? In fact some of the comments from his fans for the trailer shocked me, the trailer was cringe (and that is nicely put). I think it is his time now to again, do some sensible movies, not take any creative decisions, and work with good directors. If not, he may go SRK's route of having to take some years to come back with a bang. Without age-shaming, he is not in the time anymore where he can just do baseless movies. Is it only me- but the moment I knew it was directed by Farhad Samji I knew the fate of the movie."
137,SK should also choose SRK route and choose movies very carefully and do films with good directors.
138,After watching KKBKJ I can finally say Hera Pheri 4 is Not in safe Hands 
139,Exactly the intro video says it all...... Uh pseudo cinema lobers will never accept him. The mass and family audience is loving it.
140,"But i still don't know how makers think that they will remake a masala  South movie whose dubbed versions is already in million views will create box officer number for them
Yaar sab logo ne Pawan Kalyan waali movie dekh rakhi hai katyamarudu"
141,Better than Radhe; that last line was bone chilling to say the least 
142,"May be Fahad Samji knows dark secrets of bollywood, otherwise no chance he is getting projects one after another "
143,"Burst in to laugh  after watching the intro , great start with a bang Ô∏è"
144,"Pooja Hegde is Salmaan Khan for acting..Always gets cast for a big project through connections, fan base but makes impact by how terrible the film turns out. She is like Arjun Tendulkar for MI(Bollywood). Presents potential, gets the opportunity but make sure it never works for all the advantage she gets. Even Krithi Sanon, Sara, Jhanvi, Ananya be like, Are you taking our spot"
145,We want one dedicated video for lord farhad shamji's contributions please
146,"Bro pls do review VIRUPAKSHA eagerly waiting for that , getting many positive reviews everywhere"
147,"Oh dear lord, Please Save the Hera Pheri franchise from Samji "
148,Jammy narrating the whole script so that we don't have to go through the torture 
149,How would you rank the songs from most favourite to least favourite?
150,"I think this movie was made to save on Salman's income tax purposes..to show the losses. He must have thought let's give everyone he likes a cameo role, distribute money to show losses. No-one can convince me otherwise"
151,The irony of critics reviews and ratings is that this movie already has a 7.6 rating on IMDb  even though it's released today.
152,"in telugu also ""kaatamaraayudu"" movie has mostly same story including the train fight"
153,"Being a Telugu girl , Even I got super cringed after watching yentamma song in YouTube. This absurd song being supported by Ram Charan and Victory Venkatesh was something I've not expected .This is really Matlab kuch bhi .. and even after RRR success this people are really making fun of Telugu people by stereotyping us by costumes , some gestures and weird lyrics which are not even meaningful .These songs are literally made by nursery kids as the lyrics are ""pe pe pe pe "" and ""pungi""  rhyming with ""lungi"". Like Kuch Bhi Yaar"
154,When jammy ends up criticising the film even while explaining 'The Good'
155,Veeram is a blockbuster in Tamil Nadu and it's a good watch
156,This movie is another project of Salman Khan Rozgar Yojna after Race 3.
157,we have to face this type of cringe untill the bollywood exists. because salman never gets old and he will play this type of character with young actresses everytime whether it sometime looks grt or cringe.
158,Now I am excited for Hera pheri 3
159,IS IT BAD?? YES   IS IT ENJOYABLE?? YES
160,Then only channel I trust reviews before watching a movie and hits right to its point
161,Salman and pooja is a fresh pair. Sizzling chemical reaction between the two.
162,If possible try watching virupaksha Telugu movie. It's getting great reception.
163,"How much longer will we have to tolerate the ""Most wanted Radhe bhai"" epidemic before we see the Bajrangi bhaijaan effort again."
164,You know the movie is bad when Jammy starts the video with 'good aspects' 
165,For some reason Pooja Hegde looks exhausted in this film. It‚Äôs like they made her do 2 hours of cardio before every scene or song.
166,This is going to cross 1K Crore just like Pathan 
167,"when bollywood meets tollywood (telugu) its bound to be marvelous as we have seen in this movie. venky nailed, salman nailed. director nailed the producer"
168,"I wana know if it‚Äôs any better than RACE 3 or DABANNG 3 where wisely I left before the interval  

Hopefully Salman gets back with a bang with Tiger 3"
169,"""As I mustered up the courage to create an objective analysis, bear with me"" ...Subtle "
170,I really have bad intuition for Hera Pheri 3
171,"do watch virupaksha, just now completed the show, its jaw dropping, really good movie"
172,"I am pretty sure that Sir Dr. Farhad Samji has some kind of videos of Bollywood to be given so many films as a director.

Anyone else think that the Hera Pheri series is finished with him?"
173,"I wonder if Salman is making his own creative choices or if his PR team makes them for him, because the past few films he's starred in has been straight up embarrassing."
174,"Please review Assamese movie also , I know it is out of subject for this video, but it is my request to you,  you can review mon jai and dinabandhu which available on you tube with subtitles please"
175,Respect for you bro... As I can see most of the you tube reviewers becoming samosa critics
176,"Do you want to spend some mindless time with your loved ones? Like just having fun. To laugh, not because of the film but at the film? This is exactly one of those."
177,"here comes jammy's review.. this movie is sure going to be a ""matlab kuch bhi"" wall of fame"
178,Well done jammy you survived selmon bhai's talvaar 
179,"I don't know why Salman Khan doesn't work more often with good directors . He needs to work with Kabir Khan, Ali Abbas Zafar again, why not a comedy with Raj & Dk and also new directors. With a good story, script , music he will create hysteria in the box-office again. Big hopes for Tiger 3 though."
180,Bro...watch virupaksha movie ...felt one of the best thriller in telugu
181,Marketing for such movies with social media pages pushing mems and hype content should be dealt with more criticism. I was hoping a more sensible reaction towards this movie based on the backlash cringe movies faced this year.
182,I am more worried now for Hera Pheri 3
183,"1:11 - That's the only amount of brains that the script writers put in this movie - naming the brothers on the Hindi, Urdu and English version of the word LOVE and making sure the hindi version says - ‡§Æ‡•ã‡§π instead of ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§Æ, coz PREM is copyrighted by the Bhai himself."
184,I can't  remember single memorable antagonist role by Jagapati Babu
185,The bracelet shows he doesn't even care about his movie and character..he just wears it in almost every movie wtf
186,"Shehnaz Gill had won breakthrough performance in an award ceremony, was it for this movie?"
187,"Uh oh we all know it's a bad sign when jammy starts his review with the good, but it's scary when the second good point is a hidden bad point"
188,Guys get ready for Hera Pheri 4 directed by the most successful director who made KBKJ. 
189,Now officially Hera Pheri 3 is still in danger
190,My respect for Jammy for watching this film so his subscribers don't have to suffer
191,"""Atleast it's better than Radhe""

The bar is on the floor...."
192,It's sad that the writers with meaningful stories are showed the door in Bollywood and then they go ahead and make films like these. Bollywood wake up and empower your writers!
193,The YRF Universe is the Only Project Salman has left Now for the Real Hype on Big Screen 
194,"I feel bad for the master Tamil movie remake , it‚Äôs going to be a murder of a good film"
195,Ever time I see Salman movie review i remember that tvf video making of a  starkid
196,"In defence  - Its better then Dabangg 3 and Radhe and, at the second half Bhai looks fit and good."
197,"Was having a pretty stressful day, and this helped a lot, THANKS"
198,Did not expect anything better from Salman Khan
199,Made me remember some of the nursery rhymes after hearing one of the songs :D
200,AS EXPECTED ....Farhad Samji NOLAN...
201,"Bhai is still living in 2011, chilling with friends like Samji and Thinking audience toh hai hi ch.... Well."
202,"Went to watch for the lols with mates. Theatre wasn‚Äôt even a quarter full (I live in Sydney) and the only time anyone whistled was when Ram Charan came on for his cameo during Yentamma. Only shining lights imo was Venkatesh and Jagapathi Babu. Now that my eyes bleached from that sh*tshow, can‚Äôt wait for PS2 next week"
203,"No matter what, it'll be a blockbuster for selmun fans"
204,Feeling bad for Jagapathi Babu and Venkatesh garu.
205,This review deserves theatrical release 
206,Today One Telugu Movie Released Virupaksha Blockbuster Bro Huge Postive Reviews Check That Movie Aslo And Releasing Soon In Hindi Aslo I Think.
207,Other reviewers are trying so hard to win over Salman fans 
208,"Samji as director 
And
Arjun as actor"
209,"hearing jammys full review due to analysis of cringe  made me think
""kisi ka saaraansh kisi ka vistaar"" "
210,Feeling Shivering for Hera Pheri 3
211,Jammy bhai will compensate this in tiger 3. Maybe will not be on autopilot mode 
212,Blockbuster KBKJ nice movie  enjoyed Sunday Hyderabad housefull show KBKJ 
213,"First tamil nadu 
Now telugu states are getting stereotyped by bollywood. Thank God we Kannadigas are safe"
214,Are you going to make a video on Jubilee? Loved the series.
215,This is not a film. This is Bhai 's God complex.
216,There was a time when my excitement level was at peak for salman khan's film but now really don't have strength to watch his evry movie.
217,Sometimes I feel bad for Jammy for watching such films
218,Now I'm concerned what hera pheri 3 will comes out as 
219,"Man, this was a no brainer expected from Bhoi.."
220,I was so waiting for this review to relax my mind n have a good laugh
221,@jammypants YOU ARE BACK!!! I wonder what happened to you when reviewing Pathaan. A cringe movie needs to be called out as cringy no matter who is cast in it. 
222,Awesome movie 
223,Can't even watch the review completely hat's off to you for watching in theatre
224,"Bro, you should watch and review telugu film virupaksha...... The film was very good..."
225,"No matter what the content of the film, Salman bhai Eid release will mint 200 crores. 
That's it."
226,"I just came back from the theatre, this is my personal analysis-
The goods-
The train sequence
Salman's intro sequence "
227,"The curious case of Pooja Hegde and her script selection apart, who from the Southern states mentions things like 'hamare south mein', considering how different each state, culture and language is? Oh wait... I'm expecting regular logic and meaningful representation in Bhai movies. Okay, I'll stop. "
228,Salman khan once he ruled the Bollywood but now it‚Äôs just the thing he deserves I hope so 
229,"I think this is the only Movie, Jammy has done more videos on!! "
230,TOP 10 QUESTIONS SCIENCE STILL CAN'T ANSWER: HOW DOES FARHAD SAMJI KEEP GETTING WORK??!!!
231,"Trailer given me the vibe "" ee ka Bawaseer bana diye ho"""
232,"Farad samji the great the legend the one and only , he is everything. What not.  Bollywood is not respecting him. It worshipping him. Giving a great masterpieces like housefull4 bachan panday etc.. thank u sir thank u so much ."
233,"The length of the video you had to create just to push all your thoughts about this movie, speaks for itself that how good (so bad that it's good) this movie is."
234,"Jagapathi Babu before Movie Release : It is better to play Villain of Salman Khan rather playing second lead
The Movie : "
235,Jammy pls give us the spoilers so that we don't have to set ourselves for this cringe
236,"8:04 
Only highlight is a small dialouge in the whole 2hr 24m movie, tells everything about this movie."
237,This movie will be the final nail in the coffin for Pooja Hegde's career.
238,Can't expect any good from Farhad Samji!!!  Still this guy gets big projects in his kitty surprisingly
239,"Jammy requesting you to review ""Chengiz"" too... It's much better than kkbkkj and deserves much acknowledgement."
240,Virupaksha telugu movie review  super hit talk in theater's
241,Thanx jimmy for taking the one for all seriously ...ur suffering will save many!!
242,Vijendra Singh is an actor now! Noice.
243,"Salaman bhai 
The God of Swag of Indian cinema"
244,How Farhad samji still has a job is beyond me!
245,Can we raise a petition to not let Farhad Nolanji direct Hera Pheri 3? We can't let him destroy our nostalgia.
246,In 2:47 Bhai Smartly Endorse Being Human at the back of the frame 
247,Jassi Gill and Shehnaaz Gill ki toh life badal  dali Sallu bhai ne
248,"Need Yaathisai review.. 
Understandable when u remake a 2014 standard Movie which was clearly based on a 1980 Movie' Murattu Kaalai' "
249,"Salman took efforts in this movie, he do worked hard to get those abs "
250,I feel pity for HP3 now
251,"Salman khan has realised he doesn't need to put in any effort into the story and plot. As long as he is there with action sequences he will earn the money.

I really had hoped things would change past Bajrangi bhaijaan and sultan. Those movies showed he can act and give us a good story. I am all for masala movies but i think it would be a stretch to call this one a masala movie."
252,"If you want to destroy someone's career, just give them a movie with Farhad Samji "
253,You are absolutely hilarious in the first few secs
254,"Well, this movie has Jagapathi Babu sir so technically if you do not see this movie, half of the life is waste!!! "
255,"If this film was of Srk you would have loved it, did pathan did not have cringe dialogues, it have but you liked everything"
256,Even Bachhan pandey is a masterpiece nowÔ∏è
257,It‚Äôs sad how actresses like Pooja Hegde cement their image as eye candy and don‚Äôt mind it at all
258,I mean what did you expect from farhad samji 
259,"I am sure Salman Khan has the charm and personality, to be Bollywood's Ballya. 
Bad scripts
Auto pilot
Nursery poems as dialogues "
260,Bro Please review the Bengali pan India film 'Chengiz'. I promise it is a realy good movie.
261,Veeram was a commercial movie and it's a family watch and a family entertainer the songs were good and the story was meh I would say it's not worthy of a remake the brothers in veeram were so loving you'd actually get convinced that they are his brothers and the bond between them was just pure.  Tamanah as a girl who hates violence was depicted well compared to this ....whatever this was moreover the styling of characters just annoys me like why does Salman have long hair as far as I know in veeram ajith was not a gangster or sth  and tamanah actually looked like she hated violence and was inclined towards simplicity in fact her whole family would be living in a simple house with simple principles here however everything is shown with grandeur which does not add up to their assigned personalities this movie just feels like another parody -a parody intended to mock us southies cus if they really wanted to remake a good film they could've gotten  a lot of choices but instead they chose this box office failure smh
262,Solmon bhoi never disappoint us 
263,"Satish Kaushik ji is a legend
Rest in peace sir "
264,The intro though 
265,Long music video with 3-4 action set pieces  
266,"Hi Jammy, please review Virupaksha Telugu movie which is also released today."
267, My God intro though 
268,We better watch Veeram or Katamarayadu as they were way better in acting and screenplay. The trailer itself looked absurd. Ab age ho gayi hai bhai ki
269,"Salman Khan needs to take a break for a year and reconsider is choice of films, scripts and directors."
270,It's a decent one time watch movie family entertaining movie Ô∏è
271,KRK is going to have the last laugh
272,Now just imagine Hera pheri 3
273,Looks like neigther Kisika Bhai nor Kisiki Jaan will watch this movie
274,"I luv salmon boi and kisi ka yeh kisi ka woh is Vimal award  worthy.
I rest my briefcase."
275,"Never really expected anything to begin with. Bhai's movies have gone downhill since Bajrangi Bhaijan. Plus Suzume hit the theatres this week , it's reasonable why there was no hype for KBKJ, there is absolutely no competition"
276,Just a question why aren't you reviewing the trailer of ps-2
277,"Just finished watching it 
The movie is really good & its a total mass entertainer "
278,"I regret going to the cinema to watch this movie 
I thought maybe it is bad but will be still entertaining to watch.. that was not the case"
279,"Hope u all feel good after watching this in theatre.

Hume to trailer bhi 6 inch ke Mobile me Nahi dekha Gaya."
280,Puja Hegde's consistency is even more than bjp's victory in polls 
281,Farhad Samji is the best director in the world..
282,"Bro all is well and good when will you review Jubilee
I have been seeing your videos for a long time an dI know you are a big cinephile with a taste.
Please watch it for the retro Bollywood look and politics and some truly exceptional songs.
And do drop a review"
283,I use to read poem in my school the same way you talk while reviewing 
284,"Today‚Äôs actress are happy playing eye candy roles they just don‚Äôt want to work hard like Rani kangana, priyanka deepika, even they played side roles in their initial movies but they broke the glass ceiling it took tym but they knew that they can  be much more than just entertainment props in the movies, and they did it without any support of anyone (like alia bhatt) they fought for it but now actresses like kiara, pooja they are just mediocre I mean they have the potential like kiara was good in shershah but I feel she is happy playing side love interest of the Hero and such actresses donot stay relevant for a longer tym because they just have  one asset that is their beauty and after mid 30‚Äôs they will not get any glamorous roles their career is limited to this only look at rani she is still giving hits just because of her acting talent, ppl went to theatres to watch mardani for her powerful performance, so that talent remains forever"
285,Shud hv kept the same energy for Pathaan too without following the audience majority. Pathaan had some of the cringiest dialogues‚Ä¶.
286,Farhad samji should certainly stop writing dialogues in any other movies from recent years performance.
287,"Veeram isn't a great, spectacular script. It was a simple mass commercial entertainer which came during the festive times and targeted the family audiences, and after what seemed like an era, Ajith had stopped putting on tuxedos and guns and wore a veshti for the full length movie and showed a softer, funnier side to him."
288,Kisi ka bhai kisi ka jaan == sabka saath sabka vikas 
289,"We're here for you Jammy, tumhari gardan ko kuch nahi hoga"
290,Worst thing about this movie is that i have to listen salman singing twinkle twinkle 
291,God bless Hera Pheri 3
292,"Jammy, you saw the teaser, you saw the trailer, you critised them haveily and voice out concerns on the ability of farhad samji and also had a good laugh at the dialogues, it seemed like you really weren't expecting anything special or good from thsi movie. Then why did you even put the efforts to go watch the movie first day first show?"
293,Another good thing in this pile of hot shit was the cinematography of Naiyo Lagda was sooo good
294,Fahad Samji got my respect
295,All remakes are desasters still they made next level bomb
296,Bro pls review virupaksha movie....hope u like it
297,Telugu movie has some logic... But Bollywood movies has no logic
298,It is sometimes jealousy as well ! Even Tiger 3 will fail if jealousy is in everyone's heart. Everyone is making efforts in pulling down this actor.
299,Bhai never fails to disappoint us 
300,Bhai fans have too much of black money to spend on bhai's movies
301,Having Raghav and Siddharth Nigam in cast and not giving them decent steps to dance is criminal
302,Now I am really worried for Hera Pheri 3.
303,Salman needs to work with better directors and stop doing movies only to cast people acquainted to him.
304,"Recently, I saw a movie called Pathan. 
Some of the experts Applauded it with the title mass entertainer, blockbuster best comeback etc‚Ä¶
My real thoughts after watching that particular movie was, this was same shit which we got served at the 2012-13;"
305,"Even your overwhelming aspect explanation of the movie felt underwhelming, it's high time savlon bhai should face the reality for what it is rather than staying in denial, that he is almost 60 years old, & start doing age appropriate roles."
306,Jammy's intro...
307,Pooja Hegde not choosing sitaramam is the biggest sacrifice in history of cinema.
308,"y
You should also mention the 25 year age gap between Pooja and Salman. It is insane."
309,Audience after seeing the movie: Yeh kya hai ? Yeh kyun hai ?
310,Finally Nolan Samjhi Delivered
311,"there is nothing wrong with this movie.



Selmon bhoi is just making a Selmon-level movie for his GYM devotees."
312,At this point I can protest for taking Hera Pheri back from this mangoodddddd saveeee itt..!!
313,#JUSTICE  FOR SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT
314,"Movie's original is : Veeram . Correct but Salman Khan's remakes are mostly based on Tollywood ONLY. He made this after watching #Kaatamaraayudu not Veeram. That's why it's Jagapati Babu, Venkatesh, Bhoomika & Pooja Hegde."
315,I enjoyed the film no matter what u say
316,"""Veeram"" by itself was a mediocre one and I was wondering why it has to be remade. And when I spotted Jagpati, I was damn sure that the movie will be worse than Veeram "
317,Ajith 's screen presence..and mass appeal could not be match by anyone
318,Thumbnail tag line is just awesome
319,"Keeping the good and bad aspects aside jammy, i think the hooting in the theatre's answers the entire question on how the film is. No matter how cringe the dialogues are, moral of the story is that the MASS ENJOYED THIS MASS COMMERCIAL INSPITE OF THE FILM BEING A ONE TIME WATCH"
320,"Moh, ishq and luv are the names of his brothers.... Farhad samji definitely directed this "
321,"I've lost all interest in Bollywood. They continue to cast 50-year-old male actors who are from my parents' generation with young female actors, which is disgusting. If he had a daughter, the actresses would be her age. Because of Bollywood's culture of nepotism, nothing will ever change. It is definitely declining because they simply act in their own interests and don't take the public's interests into consideration. Nothing new is created, just the same old action sequence and all. India will want to see more than what Bollywood currently has to offer as they become more educated."
322,I'd much rather see this review run in loop for 3 hours instead of watching this debacle of a movie
