       " 'pathan was absolutely amazing  srk definitely couldn t have made a better comeback    and now i m even more excited for tiger   because as it has been already hinted in this movie that both pathan and kabir are gonna have a cameo in it and its gonna be iconic    i wish even deepika s character is there i would love to watch her interacting with zoya ',\n",
       " 'john abraham is sooooooo underrated even after    years in the industry  of course  he had some bad movies but what shocks me is how producers don t want to take the risk of making anything other than action with him',\n",

       " 'siddharth anand  i feel went for more out of the box and ambitious action sequences in this one    war was rather done on safe zone like familiar car and bike chases but ofcourse well shot  and this film is written better too  he is definitely getting better at his craft ',\n",
