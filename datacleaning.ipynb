If the film\\'s screenplay would not have been written by the wonderful Shridhar Raghavan who also helped Sriram Raghvan in penning the screenplay of one of my favourite Bollywood 007 type movie, \\'Agent Vinod\\', this would have been a dud. Also Sridhar Raghvan is famous for his screenplays of \\'Aahat\\' and \\'CID\\'. I mean, I who had not read the story of Pathaan and watching it the first time was easily able to anticipate all the forthcoming scenarios. Like for example, Deepika Padukone working for John Abraham and the help to Shahrukh Khan being a flaw, then the childish gullible like scene where they imitate the small pox vaccine in an area in Afghanistan by doing makeup of some people etc. That is because I had already viewed Tom Cruise\\'s MI series and was highly overwhelmed by it. But yes, those who didn\\'t watch MI might appreciate this. Also, Shahrukh Khan with whatever bodybuilder like physique (or VFX) is no match for a natural body builder like John Abraham. I would have liked if Vidyut Jammwal would have played the role of Pathaan. Apart from Vidyut, I would only like to see Hritik or even Tiger Shroff or let\\'s say even Salman Khan fighting John Abraham. But Shahrukh is no match. But then, Shahrukh was pitched against a Goliath like Niketan Dheer in \\'Chennai Express\\'. It was like a child fighting John Rock. But that was a comedy movie, so I just laughed at it. But Pathaan was no comedy movie and watching Shahrukh Khan fight against a 6 feet 2 inched bodybuilder like John Abraham made me laugh. Controversies aside, I am not impressed by this movie and if you  really want to watch a 007 or a MI kind of Bollywood movie, go watch \\'Agent Vinod\\'.\\nRead more\\n4\\nReply\\n1 reply\\n@jordansanger2635\\n12 days ago\\nI can\\'t express how happy I am in words.

THE KING IS BACK WITH A BANG, DAMN IT ️\\n10\\nReply\\n@25sumedhkadam58\\n12 days ago\\nJohn and an intelligent badass antagonist role is a match made in heaven.\\n49\\nReply\\n·\\n1 reply\\n@nagmakhan2898\\n12 days ago\\nCan\\'t explain how thrilled and glad I felt seeing the theatre erupt in cheer for this man. The movie is everything a Bollywood fan can ask for. Deepika in action scenes was just fab. John was great as a villain. But the best part was to see the two Khans together on screen. In short, this movie was full paisa wasool.\\n20\\nReply\\n@payalgoel6434\\n12 days ago\\nOne thing that I noticed was they integrated WAR bgm into the scene of salman and srk fighting over the train . Who knows , we might see a hrithik cameo in tiger 3\\n2\\nReply\\n@pratikpokharel4575\\n12 days ago\\nI honestly was not getting the emotional depth i wished to get from the movie besides all that the action pieces and SRK/John combat really made it a good visual experience\\n7\\nReply\\n@shrawanikaranjkar6393\\n11 days ago (edited)\\nPathan was absolutely amazing! Srk definitely couldn\\'t have made a better comeback!!  And now I\\'m even more excited for Tiger 3 because as it has been already hinted in this movie that both Pathan and Kabir are gonna have a cameo in it and its gonna be iconic !! I wish even Deepika\\'s character is there I would love to watch her interacting with Zoya.\\nReply\\n@nishchalmenon7726\\n12 days ago\\nI actually loved the BGM and the chemistry between Pathaan and Rubiah. It did work for me. The VFX did not, reallt bad according to todays standards. But overall a good massy action flick with SRK at his supreme glory\\\\\\n4\\nReply\\n@vijayasrinivasan8782\\n10 days ago\\nSurpringly no one has commented on the mismatch of shahrukhs face and body.it looks really funny.\\n5\\nReply\\n@niksiesm\\n11 days ago\\nAll the joy this movie has brought to people all over the world has made me internally truly happy for SRK; I was rooting for his success for last 10 years and always kept rooting even when his movies were underwhelming. If you ain’t loyal, r u really a fan anyway!\\nReply\\n@omsainarendra6604\\n12 days ago\\nPathaan was a good entertaining film. SRK is back and looks and what an entry scene just goosebumps . John as villain was perfect . The action between the two was just freaking awesome .Deepika with Machine gun was enough for me to see her spark  . Even though this felt similar to Mission Impossible 2 Plot , just the cameo of Salman Khan is enough to create havoc at the theatre , omg what a freaking cameo. thanks to boycott bollywood gang - theatres have turned in to stadiums . Hyderabad loves u SRK and man what a Comeback . Definitely Agree with ur review Anmol -  always great content  to watch .\\nRead more\\n2\\nReply\\n@arnabmukherjee9433\\n12 days ago\\nJohn Abraham is sooooooo underrated even after 20 years in the industry. Of course, he had some bad movies but what shocks me is how producers don’t want to take the risk of making anything other than action with him\\n6\\nReply\\n@dwipanditaborah4658\\n12 days ago\\nJammy, i cannot express my happiness for SRK. He deserves this love, he deserves the blessings of people. The fans deserved this too. Srk can never be the face of hate but only and ONLY LOVE ️ i watched it FDFS and i stopped out of the theatre smiling and crying and just so happy.\\n1\\nReply\\n@sharmassiddharth\\n10 days ago\\nMy only issue with SRK movies is that Pakistanis, even ISI shown in good light and prime antagonist is a often an Indian Army Officer gone rogue .. be it John of Pathan or Sunil Shetty of Mai Hun Na\\n2\\nReply\\n@bijoyyohanan\\n12 days ago\\nPathaan, Tiger, Kabir.

You were among the few creators who supported srk during his bad phase both professionally and personally. Wishing for your immense growth ️.\\n2\\nReply\\n@technologassam728\\n12 days ago (edited)\\nI cried so many times, I was so happy to see him in the big screen after so long , and of with a compelling and well executed movie and storyline. There was constant hooting and clapping throughout the movie, what a movie. Literally a comeback that SRK deserved  . The Dimple Kapadiya scene and of course the Bhaag Pathaan bhaag made me cry so hard. I have no other words PATHAAN is not just a movie, it\\'s an emotion, it\\'s a festival\\nRead more\\n19\\nReply\\n2 replies\\n@vimalmannapurath9651\\n12 days ago (edited)\\nSiddharth Anand, I feel went for more out of the box and ambitious action sequences in this one....War was rather done on safe zone like familiar car and bike chases but ofcourse well shot. And this film is written better too. He is definitely getting better at his craft.\\nRead more\\n4\\nReply\\n@ashi5305\\n12 days ago (edited)\\nFinally saw this in the 🇺🇸 in Imax truly made to be seen there.
