One of the most anticipated films finally released and no one cares! #cirkus starring #ranveersingh and directed by #rohitshetty is an embarrassment of a movie and I don't say this often. The #bollywood movie also starring #jacquelinefernandez and #poojahegde among several  …

Never thought a genuinely bad Ranveer Singh performance was possible, but this is honestly right up there with Ranbir in Besharam and Varun in Coolie No 1. Will never not get irritating when directors let accomplished actors get away with trashy performances!

Perhaps an unpopular opinion: maybe Ranveer relies on the competitive quality in his films, sharing screen space with really charismatic/well known actors who he knows could/might steal the scene and so he’s forced to bring his a-game (example: Shahid Kapoor in Padmavat). Maybe explains why he comes to life in the Deepika item song because he has to match the skill and presence his wife brings (also I’m sure he just loves being with her!) Other scenario, Ranveer excels when the character is so demanding he’s motivated to prove himself (like 1983 or anything Sanjay Leela Bhansali). Sounds like he was just bored and could barely manage to phone it in

Back in 2012, Rohit Shetty offered two films to Srk. One was Chennai Express and the other one they called it Angoor remake. I don't know but for some reason I think what Rohit was offering Srk was this script ( circus). I am so glad that Srk chose Chennai Express.

I totally agree with you, both the director and the star have fallen victim to being in the company of ""yes men"". They both seem to have lost their mojo, the star from the last two films and the director from his last movie. from the get-go the colour of the film can make you ""colour blind"", its too colourful, artificial for one taste. The star & the director needs to do serious contemplation about their creative choices. One suggestion pro bono I would like to give is to get rid of Farhad Samji from your entire universe.

The real robbery in our country over the past 3 years is that we have been robbed of a cinematic coversation itself. There was a time when the cinematic conversations were around Baazi and Jaal and Pyaasa and mera naam joker and hum dono and guide. Then a time where it was Yash chopra for eg. Then RGV. Then kashyap. And now brahmastra and KGF and Pushpa and cirkus is all we talk about. We have been robbed of a good conversation about cinema. You meet someone and they have to ask ‘have you seen brahmastra’ for eg. I really miss a better cinematic conversation scape.

Not having liked a Rohit Shetty film is not new, but he was not wrong about bollywood just concentrating on movie viewing audience of Bandra to Andheri. All the big banners mostly target the high paying class audience who inherently are following the so called west, hence most of the concepts are either borrowed or copied from West. Then comes something original and rooted like Kantara or a Tumbaad and bollywood thinks how are they getting so much attention.

Sanjay Mishra's comic timing helped the audience to sit through this. Also Sidharth was good.. other golmal actors were wasted.. as if there were some compulsion ki sabko movie me Lena hai.. chahe role ho ya na..
Did not understand why Ranveer(except in current Laga) and Pooja looked tired throughout the movie. No idea why people still take Jaquelin in movies. it is weird that these guys still think that slapping a guy or watching actors make funny faces will make the audience laugh.. They must be feeling, ""actors jab hasenge or muh banayenge tho log tho hasi denge""!

Rohit was too much over confident about himself. He used talented actors (except....you know)  but failed to use them well, you need to know that only good actors cannot success a film,  different genre needs different scripts different way. We still like hera pheri and Akshay's old comedy movies because they were in different genre and had different way of presenting them. For me simply presented movies like dhol, weekly malamaal are way better than the mass produced and over saturated movies.

Gulzar's Angoor, was a remake of Do Dooni Chaar, which was a remake of the 1963 Bengali movie Bhrantibilas starring Mahanayak Uttam Kumar and Bhanu Bannerjee. Bhrantibilas was based on the 1869 play of the same name, written by Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar which was loosely based on Comedy of Errors by William Shakespeare.

He shouldn't stick to the old examples, rather constantly reinvent himself. I guess he'll learn from his mistake now.

This movie has joined the league of Himmatwala and Humshakals.
Words like pathetic & horrible will also fall short. Pooja Hedge's fourth disaster of the year after Beast, Radhe Shyam and Acharya. Ranveer's third consecutive commercial failure. Unbearable!

Usually even when Rohit Shetty gives a bad trailer the movie itself turns out to be good. But this time the film was exactly what the trailer showed: an absolute cringefest. The fact that this is a prequel to Golmaal Again, which was a far better movie, is an insult.

Personally, I liked it. Not on the level of other Rohit Shetty films but, I kinda enjoyed it nevertheless. Siddharth Jadhav also was very good. He dit what was offered to him truthfully. Yes the grading was awful and over the top. Also, in one scene where the tram is running in the background where Ranveer talks to Sanjay Mishra for the first time, you could see the fps dripping and the tram kinda lagging. For a movie shot during covid, they still managed to do a good job

It was inevitable, Rohit Shetty has been feeding the audience nonsensical movies in the name of comedy aided by atrocious writer Farhad. Only Golmaal 1 was a proper entertainer, the rest was just a franchise. Frankly speaking, the comedy genre has regressed since Priya darshan left Bollywood.

Ranveer Singh is an amazing actor and we all know about his lager than life personality as well. I just don't think movies where he acts as himself (or the image of him) are doing him any good. All the movies he did this year have been major flops

The trailer itself suggested what we had in store. This review does not come across as surprising. This time hopefully the audience will act with 'samajhdhari' and give the film the verdict it deserves to be,  a DISASTER.

As I had mentioned after watching the trailer - “This over-saturated, over-cast, over-the-top-humour collage of Dad Jokes from Grandad’s era seems over-hyped” RS should have remade the other DESI version of “The Comedy of Errors” which is “Bade Miyan Chhote Miyan!” It would have been much more right up RS’s alley with Action and Comedy! But this, as you said, is taking even his fan’s for granted!

To be honest most of rohit shetty movies aren’t great …I get that there is large audience for it and I respect the person for the hard work he has done and the brand he has created …and some of his action scenes sequences are great …but I feel even that audience taste is evolving and he needs to adapt …It is said that he has the most connect with the people in Hindi film industry and the numbers don’t lie, but it feels like instead of improving the quality of his films he is holding the audiance back by giving them below average  remade content wrapping it as mass cinema with big stars.But hopefully he will be able to see through the mist of success and bring out better films in the future .

Poor Anmol. We are sorry you had to endure this circus  but we love you!!! I knew this film was going to be a mess from the trailer fam. I don't think Ranveer is cut out for slapstick comedy whether it's a good script or not.
I also don't think Ranveer and Rohit are a good fit for each other at all. Ranveer is naturally over the top, he needs a director that can tame that for comedy and commercial films, not someone who will egg him on to do as he pleases because he always ends being a complete caricature.

Seeing how bad cirkus is actually hurts as a Rohit shetty fan myself, when I heard this is going to be a comedy film I was prepared to relive the fun I had when watching All the best, chennai express and the golmaal movies. The trailer disapointed me and seeing the reviews makes me skip a rohit shetty movie for the first time. I feel Rohit working with Farhad samji was what made this bad even the comedy in sooryavanshi was not to the rohit shetty standard thanks to Farhad Nolan Samji's Kadar khan like dialogues and Jeetu Joseph like intelligent writing(This is sarcasm tho). I do hope Rohit takes this as a lesson to be learnt

I still can't understand that,  if you are good at something, you every product should come close to that standard, how come Bollywood fails so miserably.
Bollywood is the only place where standard deviation from the mean benchmark is way too much.

Yes. Jammy even i noticed arrogance ego of rohit shetty in recent interviews and promotions. His thinking of only he can make a proper masala film, and he knows keys to trigger audience is going to ""lae dooba"" his films. His equations with comedy is clearly on wrong tracts after chennai express. Shouldn't say this but he really needed reality check of failure of cirkus, cause he needs to understand his funny or even farhad samji's writing is not freaking funny at all!!!!!!

I get a feeling that Rohit Shetty will soon become like Manmohan Desai, when his formulas will no longer click with the new set of audience. He always made remakes, or showed the same action over and over again. He really needs to change other wise his next projects might face a similar fate like Cirkus. I think large portion of people don't even know about Cirkus, the promotion were very weak.

Just to add a vital information in your video the 1963 bengali movie Bhranti Bilash starring Super star Uttam Kumar, Shabitri Chatterjee, Bhanu Bandopadhyay, Sandhya Roy and several others adapted from the drama written by Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar originally based on William Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors. This movie was a jewel of its time later on copied by film director Gulzar as Angoor which in my opinion is a very cheap version of the original Bengali movie.

It's disturbing to see how the failures of all four films starring Pooja Hegde, this year, are being attributed to her in the comments. If they were hits, would you give her the credit for it? #justasking

The trailer was shi**y so I saw it was coming. Ranveer Singh's acting is bery loud on screen adn Sanjay Mishra is an actor who is actually watchable, he is one of my favourite actors.

With the kind of films over the past 3-5 years, i wonder if Bollywood will even exist in the near future.
Lack of originality, cringe content and humor, copying films from other parts of the country/world and remaking it, pathetic remakes, favouritism leading to compromising of talent in key movies & roles etc and the list goes on.

Rohit Shetty never sounded arrogant.  He never said or meant in any of his interviews that he is invincible. That's again an inaccurate narrative based out of your own judgement. It seems like you were waiting for this failure to happen. Movie may have been a flop but not because of his arrogance or overconfidence but rather the content.

1,
2,
3,"Very few actors have a year like Pooja Hegde had. She left her mark in every industry - Radhe Shyam, Beast, Acharya and Cirkus."
4,Didn't we see this coming tho honestly? The trailer itself was....well self-explanatory. But do feel bad for jammy. Our strongest warrior who puts up through sh*t like this. We are forever indebted jammy
5,Pooja Hegde does not disappoint in choosing bad movies!!
6,"Never thought a genuinely bad Ranveer Singh performance was possible, but this is honestly right up there with Ranbir in Besharam and Varun in Coolie No 1. Will never not get irritating when directors let accomplished actors get away with trashy performances!"
7,"This is highest milestone in 'Matlab Kuch Bhi' genre from Rohit Shetty. N Farhad Samji is the writer btw.
Respect "
8,If the comedy film has double role it meant to be disaster.
9,"I think rohit shetty's downfall critically started after chennai express in 2013 
That was last full masala film I liked.
After that Dilwale,simmba & sooryavanshi were financially blockbuster but werent that great."
10,Movies like this always reminds me how hard and frustrating sometimes the job of Movie Reviews could get.
11,"Perhaps an unpopular opinion: maybe Ranveer relies on the competitive quality in his films, sharing screen space with really charismatic/well known actors who he knows could/might steal the scene and so he’s forced to bring his a-game (example: Shahid Kapoor in Padmavat). Maybe explains why he comes to life in the Deepika item song because he has to match the skill and presence his wife brings (also I’m sure he just loves being with her!) Other scenario, Ranveer excels when the character is so demanding he’s motivated to prove himself (like 1983 or anything Sanjay Leela Bhansali). Sounds like he was just bored and could barely manage to phone it in"
12,"Back in 2012, Rohit Shetty offered two films to Srk. One was Chennai Express and the other one they called it Angoor remake. I don't know but for some reason I think what Rohit was offering Srk was this script ( circus). I am so glad that Srk chose Chennai Express."
13,"Pooja hegde and Jacqueline are the two most jinxed actors, which ever projects they choose are turning out to be disastrous. Once saleable actors like Ranveer, Ayushman, Akshay are thirsty of hits..."
14,Pooja hegde seems to be choosing the worst of the films right from her debut in Bollywood. I really love the actress & would like to see her deliver some masterful performance
15,This is one of the worst films of 2022! Hands down!
16,A reality check was long overdue for Rohit Shetty. In the last few years all his interviews reeked of extreme arrogance.
17,"The trailer for this was shown with Avatar 2, it was so hard to survive that 5 or so minutes. Hats off to you bro "
18,"I have new found respect for you and other film critics who are courageous enough to sit through such movies, even though the writing was on the wall when trailer itself was launched. I wouldn't do it even if some one paid me to watch movies like this."
19,Even by Rohit Shetty's standards this is a massive brainfart.
20,"Originally written in a Latin play Menaechmi by Platutus (date unknown)

Popularized in english by Shakespeare- Comedy of Errors (1594)"
21,I also feel Ranveer is amazing in serious roles and thats his forte i have personally only enjoyed his performances in SLB films.
22,"I totally agree with you, both the director and the star have fallen victim to being in the company of ""yes men"". They both seem to have lost their mojo, the star from the last two films and the director from his last movie. from the get-go the colour of the film can make you ""colour blind"", its too colourful, artificial for one taste. The star & the director needs to do serious contemplation about their creative choices. One suggestion pro bono I would like to give is to get rid of Farhad Samji from your entire universe."
23,"In the current climate, it is important to evaluate what the term ""mass cinema"" means. Mass cinema should not just mean over-the-top action, comedy, badass bgm, and all that. It should be supported by a better story!! Mass matlab ye nahi ki mehnat nahi karni, on the contrary you should be trying harder than usual"
24,Only surviving the trailer itself proves Darwin's theory. Surviving the entire movie would be like making a temple in his respect️
25,The fact that you didn't even mention the names of actresses says a lot about their role 
26,Finally people are understanding that Roshit is a $$$hitt filmmaker... i am surprised how he survived in tje industry for so long... bollywood audience consumed every $$$hittt made by him are finally regained their consciousness
27,I recently came across an interview of Rohit Shetty where he was totally dismissive about the rise of Pan India movies especially our beloved South Indian movies which shows his arrogance and disrespect for art and great filmmakers which ideally sums up the mindset and fear of Hindi film producers.
28,This should've been an OTT film and Govinda Naam Mera should've been released in cinemas as it was a great watch 
29,"honestly, Rohit shetty needed this reality check he fumbled big time with this with avatar still crushing it, but Ranveer in my opinion really had a lukewarm year hope he bounces back, this movie felt like it was just shot on the leftovers of the Golmaal 4 sets. i didn't spend a nickel  but feel for the people who have to"
30,Hey! No Teletubbies Slander! That’s pure art and perfection. Don’t ruin my childhood like this 
31,"After Nani's gorgeous film ""Ninnu Kori,"" Nivetha Thomas had the potential to because a star in Telugu cinema with just her expressive eyes and performance... but around the same time, us Telugu audience gave Pooja Hegde more attention after Allu Arjun's lackluster DJ... and all the top producers and directors turned her into a star for her glamour and skin show to be frank"
32,"At the time of trailer launch, when Aashish Chanchlani was praising this movie too much, at that moment only i've imagined the caliber of the film."
33,"‘Roy, Joy and the Multiverse of Madness’ sounds like a nice title. I might trademark it."
34,"The one thing I like about you is you follow artists, you watch their interviews and everything so that you know what’s going on in their head and then you include that also in your videos like you talked about Rohit saying that most of the directors don’t know anything beyond Bandra. "
35,those days are gone when Bollywood took us for granted..
36,"Ranveer has to seriously tone down his public antics. They are just pissing people off from watching his films no matter how good they are. If he thinks he can fool around off screen and compensate for it on screen and that's gonna be accepted, it's a big Y-E-S NO!"
37,The real robbery in our country over the past 3 years is that we have been robbed of a cinematic coversation itself. There was a time when the cinematic conversations were around Baazi and Jaal and Pyaasa and mera naam joker and hum dono and guide. Then a time where it was Yash chopra for eg. Then RGV. Then kashyap. And now brahmastra and KGF and Pushpa and cirkus is all we talk about. We have been robbed of a good conversation about cinema. You meet someone and they have to ask ‘have you seen brahmastra’ for eg. I really miss a better cinematic conversation scape.
38,I THINK SAJID KHAN OR FARHAD SAMJI DIRECTED THIS MOVIE IN THE NAME OF ROHIT SHEETY
39,"Jammy's first line : Zindagi aur film industry ka ek usool hota hai ( in Hindi ) , went back and checked twice if it's really tried and refused productions "
40,"“Bhrantibilas” in Bengali starring Uttam Kumar is perhaps the best adaptation of the Shakespeare story , would request to watch it for once "
41,"The amount of promotions they were doing for this movie, going for literally every TV show and doing Ads in Ads (Ching's Chinese) was itself a red flag how ""good"" the movie will be and how ""good"" it will perform."
42,"They often say masses will love it
It made me question whether I don't belong to masses
Masses love good stories which have emotions in right place across the genre
Golmaal 1 was good because it got emotions right with all the character and fun"
43,How Jacqueline and Pooja continue to get movies is beyond me. I guess they get picked for movies that no other actress wants knowing fully well that there is zero potential for their role.
44,"Rohit Shetty's comedies just died with Golmaal 3.  Cirkus was also doomed the moment I saw Farhad Samji as dialogue writer and the trailer confirmed it. Saturation, bad vfx, bad dialogues, unnecessary big scale for ""comedy movie"""
45,"The more bollywood tries to recreate Angoor , it makes Angoor more and more masterpiece..
Sanjeev kumar .a legend"
46,"Jammy, I have been meaning to ask you, can you do a segment on old school films and directors of bollywood? I was watching Wajood, 1988, by N. Chandra, and I realised, there were some great films back then, and the directors were good too. This is more like a request, that a video on these old school directors and movies would be amazing (for me at least)  "
47,i think you should show your face in your videos..u will get more recognition
48,"You see these great actors doing really well in emotional, thrillers, method acting and so on. Once they try a comedy genre, they fail miserably which really shows how diffcult it is to make people laugh."
49,"Farhad Samjhi getting involved in another ""comedy"" project and absolutely and literally killing it with his masterful writing. The fact that this guy is getting movies is hilarious and tragic at the same time. But hey, we're gonna get some more Matlab Kuch Bhi content from this film, so, it's okay I guess️"
50,"Was watching this video at Goregaon station bus depot and saw a lady, booking a show for this movie, one of the few times I've genuinely felt bad for a stranger"
51,Bollywood never disappoints to disappoint
52,"Why is everyone so shocked? Lol, didn’t we already know that it will be shit from the posters/ teaser and ofc the trailer? Or was it only me 

but poor jammy always has to go through trauma to entertain us"
53,Sanjay Mishra in the promotional material reminded me of yesteryear Hindi Cinema Comedy Veterans. Comedy Hall of Fame deserves him.
54,"Honestly, this was presumed by a lot. The trailer itself was so cringe to watch that it was well understood that this movie is going to be a disaster. Bollywood never disappoints :D"
55,"Absolutely loved this movie, was laughing hysterically from start to finish. It was ranveers best movie yet, every scene was cracking me up... 
Joking :)"
56,"I have just watched Rohit Shetty's podcast with Ranveer. And I was stunned that this  guy is behind cirkus. His movies are family friendly, but does it have to be cringe? Basically family friendly = spoonfeeding cringe comedy. This should have been uploaded on Facebook then."
57,Jammy you have my respect for watching Cirkus while being in the UK and sitting through the damn thing️
58,"Absolutely! You could see from Rohit Shetty""s body language and grin from the promotions ... that he has been sold by his chamchas that the films is a masterpiece...could be see it coming right when the posters were released...a good kick on his backside"
59,"Indian parents: mental breakdown is a myth
Bollywood: agar aapne ye nahi dekha tho kuch nahi dekha "
60,I think if this movie was released before 2019 this would be a blockbuster.
61,"I went on tears while and after watching movie, becz not only the jokes were saturated the colour gradings was also.... "
62,We thought humshakals is the worst case scenario..but these movies (cirkus) are like covid variants..every year theres a new variant of headache
63,Thank you for saving me the horror. I was planning to watch it tonight. 
64,"Keeping the movie aside, I think this is your best-written video ever. It is filled with similes, metaphors, imagery, kind of awesome"
65,Makes me think- is Rohit Shetty the new Sajid Khan who similarly lost track of what the audience would like to watch in a theatre?
66,The trailer itself gave a glimpse how the main picture is going to be.
67,"Not having liked a Rohit Shetty film is not new, but he was not wrong about bollywood just concentrating on movie viewing audience of Bandra to Andheri. All the big banners mostly target the high paying class audience who inherently are following the so called west, hence most of the concepts are either borrowed or copied from West. Then comes something original and rooted like Kantara or a Tumbaad and bollywood thinks how are they getting so much attention."
68,Sorry you had to endure such a terrible movie and thank you for enduring the pain so that we don't have to.
69,Wasn't this so expected. I mean the trailer was out there and it was well predicted how the movie will turn out.
70,Seems like 2022 was reality check for all the filmmakers in terms of what works what not
71,"Ranbir’s Shamshera andBesharam, Ranveer’s Cirkus, Hrithik’s Mein Prem Ki Diwani Hu will go down as embarrassing disasters of these respective actors."
72,"When i saw the trailer, it showed so many colors, that time itself it was a big no.. And already Ranveer singh ko jhelna is difficult, and imagine 2 Ranveer Singh's  means banda pagal hokar hi bahar ayega."
73,With this supporting cast they could've done wonders.
74,Jammy didn't hold himself back this once. The 40 quids really got him 
75,"This was one of your most sincere, honest and best reviews. Bollywood needs a detox!"
76,Please post a review on Double XL. I have already watched it but your review sheds light on every movie in a way I cannot perceive by myself. I really want to know your opinion on this film which talks about a major social issue.
77,And i saw Rohit Shetty interview. He is reminding us his old remakes.
78,"Heyy jammy,  did you see pitchers S2 cuz I binged  it today only and I must say man it lived upto it's expectations!! Maybe I am wrong but I got to say that It IS BETTER than S1. Do tell me your thoughts and maybe it could help you redeem yourself from this trauma."
79,"Sanjay Mishra's comic timing helped the audience to sit through this. Also Sidharth was good.. other golmal actors were wasted.. as if there were some compulsion ki sabko movie me Lena hai.. chahe role ho ya na..
Did not understand why Ranveer(except in current Laga) and Pooja looked tired throughout the movie. No idea why people still take Jaquelin in movies. it is weird that these guys still think that slapping a guy or watching actors make funny faces will make the audience laugh.. They must be feeling, ""actors jab hasenge or muh banayenge tho log tho hasi denge""!"
80,"Rohit was too much over confident about himself. He used talented actors (except....you know)  but failed to use them well, you need to know that only good actors cannot success a film,  different genre needs different scripts different way. We still like hera pheri and Akshay's old comedy movies because they were in different genre and had different way of presenting them. For me simply presented movies like dhol, weekly malamaal are way better than the mass produced and over saturated movies."
81,"Gulzar's Angoor, was a remake of Do Dooni Chaar, which was a remake of the 1963 Bengali movie Bhrantibilas starring Mahanayak Uttam Kumar and Bhanu Bannerjee. Bhrantibilas was based on the 1869 play of the same name, written by Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar which was loosely based on Comedy of Errors by William Shakespeare."
82,"The therapy is.. Pitchers season 2. I completed it. Awaiting your reviews. In my viewpoint, I loved it. Jeetu was missed, but still its a masterpiece in itself. And TVF is anyways TVF. Review soon.."
83,"“It’s hollow, artificial and extremely fake - and I’m just talking about the colors right now!” "
84,Finally people have come to the sense that Rohit’s comedy is also going off rain track. That was visible in 2017 Golmaal.
85,Makes me really appreciate the double role movies by govinda/david dhawan jodi.
86,"These days most of the  Bollywood actors and filmmaker are so overconfident about there art work that they don't take seriously . They are more focused on other things like promotions , big names and award shows. They still thinks audiences are fool."
87,Happy to see Ranveer and Rohit sheety getting pool critically and commercially
88,"In other movie industries star power leads to good day 1 collections where as in bollywood only content works even on day1, kantara is the best example of good content working for a whole month in theatres ."
89,They exposed themselves in kapil sharma show by saying this movie made during covid and story was written just to clear some targets
90,i had no expectations already since it’s a Rohit Shetty release
91,Circus is successfully registered in the league of 'Humshakals' 
92,"I'm surprised how on earth Sanjay Mishra choose to be in a brainless venture like this especially after delivering his performance of lifetime in his most recent venture ""Vadh""!!! That movie  was an absolute masterclass and movies like ""Vadh"" certainly needs our ️ and patronage."
93,Just when I was watching Ram setu yesterday and wondering how silly can it get then this drops in. Thus proven there is always room for improvement in every scenario
94,Cirkus in Rohit Shetty's life is what Ram Gopal Varma ki Aag in RGV's life.
95,"Laughed a lot watching this. As a comedy movie, it is spot on."
96,You can watch Haami 2 a bengali film to get better from this torture. It also has English subtitles. It's really beautiful and an emotional film
97,"I feel sorry for you Jammy. Thank you, you go through all of this for us "
98,"Considering Ranveer is literally everywhere from formula one races, to fifa to many awards show can be tiring. But like you said, it was confidence cum arrogance of Rohit Shetty about knowing the audience. Also, what's the point of the two leading ladies who consistently have been doing bad movies but still continue to do so"
99,"Telly tubbies reference was hilarious , that one liner was enough to get the essence.."
100,Rohit Shetty’s movies look like they’re meant for theatrical stage plays rather than making a big budget movie … I’m sure we’ll enjoy the same movie as a play
101,"I was waiting for this Video..
I have to say with rohit shetty films the trailers do end up speaking for the movie ,like the cop universe trailers and even golmaals the story was gonna be hilarious and his style was evidence this from the trailer felt absurd..."
102,I'm actually worried for Jammy.... Putting his brain through all of this torture at this age he's surely going to get brain damage when he gets old....
103,"This reminded me of Badhai Ho Rene's Mother's dialogue saying ""This family(movie) is a circus for which I don't want to buy tickets to"""
104,It never got better and I was ready to walkout ten mins in .  I should win an award for patience .
105,"I was waiting for this review the most! So other reviews and i knew your review would be EPIC
Surely funnier than the movie "
106,The saddest part is that main stream cinema has almost lost its capability to make good comedy movies. The early 2000s gave us such good movies like hera pheri hulchul humgama that even today watching it is not boring.  Rightly said by jammy shetty is taking the masses intellect for a ride. I saw the trailer n i was like.. Nope.. The last time i laughed in a comedy  movie i can remember  was in ayushmans dream girl and bala.
107,Unpopular Opinion -Sanjay Mishra is a superb actor but his comedy has become boring and repeated now...
108,The meme in every video of yours in the start is always awesome . I laughed so hard . Always sum up the feelings I have about the movie
109,"2022 will be remembered as the year when the Indian audience finally started saying NO to Bollywood trash, while South Indian cinema earned global reputation (specifically RRR)."
110,My friend literally forced us to watch this movie instead of drishyam 2 or avatar or a recently released Bengali film. Needless to say we ditched her ass by saying we will never waste our watching this shit and went ahead and watched the Bengali movie. It was worth it!
111,"I was never going to watch this movies on theatre anyways but now I am more sure about it. Thanks tried and refused production this is my first comment on your channel, I have been following you from quite a long time and It has always occurred in my mind that what if the makers of the films sees your review and what would be their reaction to it will they make changes accordingly in their next venture or they will come in a war with you."
112,Sanjay mishra never fails. I hope they treat him the same way they treat their 'superstars'
113,Rohit shetty must collect his retirement corpus amount.. and announce his retirement from film making..we will full hearted respect his decision...
114,Tellitubbies episode was on point 
115,The only reason I watched this film was I didn't want Jammy to suffer alone
116,"Tried&Refused Productions. I am completely agree with you. When i first watch the trailer i didn't laugh on a single moment. There i loose my hope & the way Rohit was promoting his film like he has made a masterpiece or something. He needs to rework on this genre. He shouldn't stick to the old examples, rather constantly reinvent himself. I guess he'll learn from his mistake now."
117,"As this year comes to an end , please make a 10 worst movies you watched this year"
118,To think that Rohit Shetty was about to improve following Sooryavanshi…
119,It's so sad that none of the top reviewer are reviewing pitchers season 2
120,Is it just me or anyone else also felt frustration in Jammy's VO in this video..
121,This would've been the easiest to beat film had they released a good film along with it
122,"Bro, can you make a video on actors roundtable specially the netflix one with Rajeev Masand. I personally feel since it was on netflix so he called all the netflix platform movie starts rather than genuinely deserved stars of the year."
123,Nothing unexpected.. I knew this since the time the trailer dropped 
124,"Last time i saw rohit shetty movie missing the spark it was ""Dilwale"". Hope he will comeback with a good comedy next time. "
125,"*before movie: looks kinda new gota try this
*After movie: Highway sounds like good place to sleep tonight "
126,"I think rohit shetty should've realize the taste of audience is temporary, he can't always use same tactics ."
127,"This movie has joined the league of Himmatwala and Humshakals.
Words like pathetic & horrible will also fall short. Pooja Hedge's fourth disaster of the year after Beast, Radhe Shyam and Acharya. Ranveer's third consecutive commercial failure. Unbearable!"
128,In the end audience would go in for a real Circus than the movie Cirkus.
129,"""Angoor"" was, is and will be a legendary movie forever️️
Jammy bhai..How did u manage to tolerate this??
""This is on steroids and its not a compliment""
I can feel you bhai..Never ever in your review, you have breezed through just to get the heck out of it.."
130,That “This is steroids and thats not a compliment” took so hard
131,I think demand of South Indian directors in bollywood is going to increasr
132,"2:04 - 2:22, 3:33 - 3:43 cracked me up so hard. Jammy being a big fat mood as always, LMAO!"
133,"Hey Jammy 
How you doing ?
Definately doing great 
I am your one of the followers who really admires you and your love for movies and your reviews are far more generous and authentic review than others which mark every details of a movie either its good or bad ."
134,"Usually even when Rohit Shetty gives a bad trailer the movie itself turns out to be good. But this time the film was exactly what the trailer showed: an absolute cringefest. The fact that this is a prequel to Golmaal Again, which was a far better movie, is an insult."
135,They even hid the reviews tab on Paytm movie bookings section
136,Shakespeare must be rolling in his grave after seeing what modern Bollywood has done to his work!!!
137,"I just loved the circus movie. It touched my soul. You have to believe that circus is the most movie of all time. It was hearttouching when the protaganist said ""it's circusing time"""
138,"I actually didn't saw the movie

And after seeing Jamey's review
I couldn't more relived "
139,He should reconsider doing the hindi remake of Anniyan. I can bet it is gonna turn out to be a damp squib.
140,I lens My empathy and support to you jammy! Hope you soon recover from this shocking incident!
141,I don't know what people expected after watching the trailer.. ofcourse it was going to be slapstick!
142,"Last 3 films of ranveer singh
83 - disaster
Jayesh bhai - disaster
Circus - disaster "
143,Hats off to Jammy. He went to see the film so that we don't have to.
144,"Me: DId you watch the entire movie without a skip to post this review?
Jammy: Yes.
Me: What did it take?
Jammy: Everything."
145,Editor of this film did Great job. Trippy comedy film good in visually. All Supporting cast did excellent job. Some people will not understand this type of editing direction so they will not gonna like. BUT I LOVED THE FILM
146,"Me, watching the review, while I didn't even manage to finish the Trailer itself. "
147,Bollywood took audience as granted .....i still wonder how Rohit Shetty last movies also a hit ...Chennai Express and Surya vanshi purely hit because of the star cast
148,Pooja hedge is giving tough competition for Jacqueline Fernandes in overacting
149,"Personally, I liked it. Not on the level of other Rohit Shetty films but, I kinda enjoyed it nevertheless. Siddharth Jadhav also was very good. He dit what was offered to him truthfully. Yes the grading was awful and over the top. Also, in one scene where the tram is running in the background where Ranveer talks to Sanjay Mishra for the first time, you could see the fps dripping and the tram kinda lagging. For a movie shot during covid, they still managed to do a good job"
150,Literally another Matlab Kuch bhi episode  2:10 Jammy's reaction makes me feel sorry for our guy..he went our of his way and lost a few good Brain cells this time I think
151,"Please watch Kotthu on prime. What a movie, Asif Ali is at his best. Only stone hearted people will not cry at the end of this political drama.
It's a pity that good movies don't get enough recognition. You will not be disappointed"
152,I kept my mind and expectations at home. It's definitely a bore at times but I found it to be a decent one time watch.
153,"There is no way I would want to watch this in a theatre... Heck, I would think twice before watching on OTT.."
154,"King Charles ||| : ""For such an act of bravery, The Royal Family from now on will call you Sir Jammy Pants "" "
155,I think only the vishal bhardwaj has the capacity to adopt William Shakespeare writings better than anyone in bollywood.
156,"Lol, I told my parents they made a mistake purchasing a ticket for this movie. They returned, described the film just as kachra and moved on with their life"
157,After watching the trailer of this film i went in to cinematic koma..
158,The problem with Bollywood is there’s too many writers so the movies don’t make sense properly. Also they shoot there movies in 40 days so actors don’t do that many retakes. It’s all about money now.
159,@1:59  I can't believe i am doing this... This line hit me hard
160,Indian are not at that level of intellect to understand this masterpiece from christopher Shetty
161,I feel bad that Anmol is losing his braincells for us 
162,When I saw the trailer I did think of separated twin but I though it was an old concept then I thought maybe ranveer came to another universe where there are two ranveer two best friends
163,"Thank God, I thought, Jammy would appreciate this movie too for it's attempt at mass genre like he did with Brahmastra"
164,Sometimes I feel like Neeraj Vohra took the comedy in Bollywood with him.
165,"Aaah... I was waiting for ur review. Now, plan changed, will watch Kaapa starring Prithviraj Sukumaran "
166,His voice in this video shows how disappointed and traumatised he is after watching the movie. XD
167,Felt like you took more of a dig at London than at Cirkus 
168,Cut to jammy taking Rohit shetty's interview.. that would be hilarious 
169,Sanjay Mishra is a legend in acting.
170,"Arrey even when I had watched the trailer I was like.. ""what happened to Ranveer Singh?"""
171,I’m going to be totally judgmental and ask why is one of the writers of this film still in circulation? How are they still employed?
172,Let's appreciate Siddharth jadhav's performance as well
173,Now we can say the trailer justified the film no laugh 
174,"Vijay devarakonda be like - ""I am not alone"" 
Vijay devarakonda and ranveer Singh two proven actors choosing shitty scripts. Especially vd"
175,There is such pain in Anmol sir's voice 
176,People want acting not overacting which ranveer singh always does
177,Rohit Shetty behaving like how Sajid Khan behaved before the release of Himmatwalaa
178,Rohit will make a strong comeback with Singham again  He is a legend 
179,ngl.. i laughed once throughtout an entire movie and that was one of those scene by sanjay mishra..... ranveer singh actually is one of the talented actor and has been in great movies consistently.... not sure why he thought this story was good
180,"Bollywood = Makes shitty films that are bound to flop
Boycott gang = Film flopped bcoz we boycotted"
181,Pooja Hegde has a very good vision while choosing films....she's delivering back to back Cult films.... 
182,I mean judwa 2 looks good infront of this film in terms of humour and slapstick. 
183,"I'm sorry but have to ask...

Dear Jammy, why are you putting yourself through so much torture for us..? Consider your health man. Sathyameva Jayate 2, Liger, The Legend (of all things). Now Cirkus..."
184,I enjoyed their episode with Kapil Sharma more than a movie.
185,Thank you so much so now I'll go back and watch Qala again because can't get enough  of it
186,Once in a decade we get such movies
187,For time period representation QALA does justice
188,"Ranveer - Band Baja Baraat showed his talents, and next movies showed how one hit wonders become disconnected from reality, fame got to his head."
189,"You can also call Cirkus as "" #ShettyKiTatti "" "
190,The ryan gosling meme is just amazing
191,"People ignore good Bollywood intelligent movies like An action hero with such a fresh concept
And a heartfelt mother son tale like Salaam Venky
Even these types of non masala movies also deserve an audience
Already an outstanding Jhund and Badhai Do were ignored"
192,Bro you saved my family's money thankyou 
193,Thanks for the honest review ...U helped  me save my money as i was about to go and watch it...I knew from the trailer this movie is going to be a train wreck....
194,The fact that I thought nothing could be worse than Current laga re inthis movie and that turned out to be the only good aspect......
195,You can really feel the pain in his voice
196,"Sometimes i ask myself, is any movie starring Jacqueline Fernandez is worth watching? 

I have tend to believe a strong presumption that if she is in a movie, she is going to be nothing more than an eye candy. Which should be kinda sorta disrespectful to her too, if she is in it to win it."
197,"Thank you for the social service, man. You deserve all the time off after watching this movie "
198,"When Anmol started video speaking Hindi, it felt PEACEFUL! "
199,Bollywood never dispoints us in disappointing 
200,2:10 we should be very thankful to this guy. As he sacrifices his sanity to protect us from mental Tortures and torments of Bad movies. 🫡
201,I loved Angoor! I still watch that movie w my dad during holidays!  Cirkus played w it so bad that it hurts! 
202,"Heyy jammy,  did you see pitchers S2 cuz I binged  it today only and I must say man it lived upto it's expectations!! Maybe I am wrong but I got to say that It IS BETTER than S1. Do tell me your thoughts and maybe it could help you redeem yourself from this trauma."
203,I could hear your frustration jammy ... Thanks for going through this for us 
204,When you mess with movie name you know what you can get in movie.
205,Congratulations to team cirkus for breaking humshakales record
206,Thank God I saw Avatar 2 which btw made sense 
207,"Jammy said no, still I am going. Hope I don't die in the theatre "
208,"Jammy please review pitchers season 2, we're waiting "
209,"Hats off to you dude , the trailer already gave quite a bit of how bad the movie would be"
210,You should watch and review Kannada movie Vedha. It's Dr Shivaraj Kumar's 125th movie. It's amazing!
211,"Your flow is so smooth,  You must have a ""The Jammy Show"" coming out ASAP.
I'd watch the stuff out of it."
212,"IN IMDB   2,693 PEOPLE GAVE THIS FILMI 10/10. "
213,The thumbnail says enough. Disappointed but not surprised
214,"I couldn't even tolerate the trailer, you are brave .....very BRAVE !!"
215,Looking forward to your review of 18 pages!
216,"Everyone trolling bollywood for giving some worst big movies this year
Bollywood be like : my worst is yet to come
Who thought another big worst movie will come in last 10 days of the year but it came"
217,I was on my way to watch this film yesterday but something urgent came up. So glad I missed it!
218,One of my friends went to watch the thing..after me telling him not to after watching the trailer..now he’s sitting here to donate his eyes & ears and also wants his time and money back 
219,"It was inevitable, Rohit Shetty has been feeding the audience nonsensical movies in the name of comedy aided by atrocious writer Farhad. Only Golmaal 1 was a proper entertainer, the rest was just a franchise. Frankly speaking, the comedy genre has regressed since Priya darshan left Bollywood."
220,Saw it from a mile away....I couldn't even bear watch the whole trailer.....movie to dur ki baat hai 
221,Ranveer singh keeps impressing us with his script and fashion choices! Keep it up!!
222,"The frames made me think of the song- 'Aa gaya Noddy, Noddy! Mil k bolo hurray' "
223,I can clearly sence the disappointment form Jammy's voice
224,i left the movie halfway and watched Saif Ali Khan's Humshakals. Seemed like a movie made in heaven in comparison
225,"Bro, please watch, Glass Onion.. You need it for sure!"
226,Your intros re getting progressively better and better..
227,Thank you for saving my Christmas from being ruined.
228,Editor of this film did Great job. Trippy comedy film good in visually. All Supporting cast did excellent job. Some people will not understand this type of editing direction so they will not gonna like. BUT I LOVED THE FILM
229,In terms of comedy Rohit is next Sajid
230,Editor of this film did Great job. Trippy comedy film good in visually. All Supporting cast did excellent job. Some people will not understand this type of editing direction so they will not gonna like. BUT I LOVED THE FILM
231,Finally a bad film from bollywood after 1 and half month
232,LOL keeping expectations from films like this itself is an achievement... Pat yourself Jammy on the back for actually watching this
233,Thank you jammy for takin one for a team....we won't forget your sacrifice
234,Editor of this film did Great job. Trippy comedy film good in visually. All Supporting cast did excellent job. Some people will not understand this type of editing direction so they will not gonna like. BUT I LOVED THE FILM
235,How do directors fail in a remake? It’s like having an answer sheet to an exam and still failing 
236,Editor of this film did Great job. Trippy comedy film good in visually. All Supporting cast did excellent job. Some people will not understand this type of editing direction so they will not gonna like. BUT I LOVED THE FILM
237,"He felt invincible even after DILWALE, LOL. Remakes like Singham and Simmba shouldn't be taken as his credit"
238,Finally Liger has a competition
239,Sanjay Mishra was easily the best of the ensemble
240,Editor of this film did Great job. Trippy comedy film good in visually. All Supporting cast did excellent job. Some people will not understand this type of editing direction so they will not gonna like. BUT I LOVED THE FILM
241,"I felt it coming..
Bollywood era is coming to an end, and masses are celebrating it"
242,"I can see it coming in  ""Matlab kuch bhi"" episode."
243,Circus is super I saw it ON DD
244,I fear Dunki will also be a damp squib
245,The frames and the clothes make me remind my last Pride parade every f**** single frame like pride parade..
246,Thank you Bollywood... Please keep giving more disasters
247,"Tough question - which one is the worst among these - radhe, heropanti 2, satyamev jayate 2, rashtra kavach Om, race 3, mrs. serial killer or cirkus? And why?

P.s. 3:26 - 3:55 best review in layman terms by jammy till now"
248,"South Indian Movies - Content 

Bollywood - Vo kya hota hai ? "
249,Please review CAT netflix series
250,Only Rajkumar Hirani is the master of making comedy with logic.
251,All I needed to watch till 0:17 of this video. I understood everything.
252,has jammy really gone to therapy bcz usually he posts a video in every 2-3 days
253,Year ending  bomb
254,"Please watch and review “vedha”, a movie from Kannada industry, I assure you won’t regret watching it for sure."
255,"It’s about time Ranveer Singh got his comeuppance. Even the great actors of the film industry were never as overconfident and arrogant as him, and he’s definitely not a great actor…just very lucky. 
But luck will only take you so far, that’s 3 consecutive flops (83, Jordar & Cirkus) in a row with more to come. "
256,10 seconds into the video and Anmol's Hindi runs out of steam. 
257,"@tried and refused productions....

On behalf of all your fans ( myself included, obviously).. I would like to thank you profusely for going through hell by watching such movies and making sure we don't get permanent brain damage  by trying them out ourselves.."
258,Editor of this film did Great job. Trippy comedy film good in visually. All Supporting cast did excellent job. Some people will not understand this type of editing direction so they will not gonna like. BUT I LOVED THE FILM.
259,Qala should be a master class project in how to plan a Color scheme and balancing frames.
260,Jammy we need DHAMAKA movie review. Ravi Teja has hit the ball out of the park
261,"Damn, you're voice has the tone of ""I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed"""
262,I request everyone to watch gulzar's angoor once. You will realize that comedy can be generated even without silly over the top situations. Comedy of errors at its best
263,"Hope Jammy You are fine after watching this.
Please take some rest "
264,this is what comedy movies have become. I think they are making it for the 5 years old children. I can't recall the last time i laughed watching a bollywood comedy movie that was intentional
265,"Is it just me or does jammy sound really really tired?  I guess it's the film. Poor you, jammy."
266,"I hadn't seen trailer & when I saw Rohit Shetty's promotional interviews, especially that ""Jahaz me chhed hota hai toh sabse pehle chuhe bhaagte hai"" one, I was pumped & looking at his confidence I thought what kind of banger he must have created... 
Those lil arrogant interviews now feel too arrogant & dumb..."
267,We need Badass Ravikumar direly to rescue Bollywood
268,"Too much optimism is even dangerous than overconfidence. Trailer itself was like a giant Tatti, my prayers for those who still gave this tatti a shot."
269,Producers should provide insurance to reviewers
270,And Rohit Shetty was taking shots at South films  in one of his interview
271,"RIP Jammy's Sanity, thank you for your service, I hope you have a good Christmas with a speedy recovery."
272,Idk what this guy is talking bout the movie was STRAIGHT ASS 
273,"Worst Film of the year 
A: Liger 
B: Cirkus
C: Other"
274,"For the first time I have seen imdb give a lowest rating to a rs movie,  pehle thoda hype badhane ke liye rating zyada de dete hai par sidhe 1.5  pehli baar imdb ne kuch sahi kiya .. main paise Bachake patthan dekhne jaa rha hoon . Thanks jammy for taking one for the team"
275,Hey Jammy! Didnt watch the movie and will probably never watch it. But from the trailer itself didnt it feel like a sort of a parody of an amalgamation of all commercial hit trops of all comedy movies?
276,"Last ""Golmaal : Again"" bhi kam nahi thi  ..... I lost my half IQ in that movie  !"
277,Hope Hirani continues his Golden run with Dunki ...
278,"Can you try and watch ""witness"" movie in Sony live give review for that movie bro, even I watched that movie from one of the comments from other subscribers on your previous video.

Thank you jammy"
279,Ranveer most overrated actor he is nothing without bhansali 
280,"Top 3 best commercial directors according to me are: Rajamouli, sukumar and trivikram  consistency is their identity "
281,Sajid Khan ki Himmatwala yaad ayi muje...Rohit sahab ka overconfidence ️
282,Do top 10 worst films of the year. There are some excellent contenders this year including cirkus. 
283,Ranveer Singh is an amazing actor and we all know about his lager than life personality as well. I just don't think movies where he acts as himself (or the image of him) are doing him any good. All the movies he did this year have been major flops
284,"You Took The Bullet for Us , Thanx For the Save Bro "
285,This is Pooja Hegde's 4th flop in a row this year.
286,The saturation was too garish. I thought it was cranked up to the maximum in Chennai Express. Didn't know it could be cranked up more 
287,"The trailer itself suggested what we had in store. This review does not come across as surprising. This time hopefully the audience will act with 'samajhdhari' and give the film the verdict it deserves to be,  a DISASTER."
288,"So basically , man wanted to make remake of angoor and end up making the infamous humshakals AGAIN "
289,Your therapy is pitchers season 2. Please review it......not as good as pitchers season 1 but what a show still.
290,Bro u really want a Commercial Mass movie then Watch Kannada movie VEDHA...typical Mass Movie but Nice screenplay and nice core Story...need of d Hour....Jai shivanna 
291,Money saved till pathaan i guess
292,Only my 13 year old brother enjoyed parts and I only liked some parts played by Sanjay Mishra sir. THATS IT.
293,Most consistent performer of the year- Farhad samji
294,Pooja Hegde always ends up getting worst possible outcome for her choice. This is what happens when you prioritise starcast instead of script.
295,"As I had mentioned after watching the trailer - “This over-saturated, over-cast, over-the-top-humour collage of Dad Jokes from Grandad’s era seems over-hyped” RS should have remade the other DESI version of “The Comedy of Errors” which is “Bade Miyan Chhote Miyan!” It would have been much more right up RS’s alley with Action and Comedy! But this, as you said, is taking even his fan’s for granted! "
296,JAMMY ....i am shocked that u didn't talk about the Oscar winning performances of Jacqueline and Pooja ....i knew what Jacqueline was for but Pooja also seriously...... horrible performances 
297,saturation is so similar to Dilwale
298,"You have my sympathy, Jammy"
299,"i just thought jammy was gonna state a dialogue when he starte ""Zindagi mein......"""
300,"To be honest most of rohit shetty movies aren’t great …I get that there is large audience for it and I respect the person for the hard work he has done and the brand he has created …and some of his action scenes sequences are great …but I feel even that audience taste is evolving and he needs to adapt …It is said that he has the most connect with the people in Hindi film industry and the numbers don’t lie, but it feels like instead of improving the quality of his films he is holding the audiance back by giving them below average  remade content wrapping it as mass cinema with big stars.But hopefully he will be able to see through the mist of success and bring out better films in the future ."
301,Please give us a review of shiva rajkumaar's vedha
302,a shakespeare adaptation? why didn’t they put vishal bhardwaj to work on this then? he would’ve slayed
303,How do you feel after spending £12(rs. 1200) on this movie 
304,Overconfidence of Rohit Shetty needed this humbling.
305,"If you've done bad things in life and
worry about karma biting you, watch
this movie. You're even. Clean slate."
306,Lol you can sense how frustrated Jammy is. This video was more of a rant than review.
307,Trailer itself looked inspired by Sanjeev kapoor classic angoor. And Rohit Shetty can never do justice to such plots
308,Jammy sounds like he is about to cry because he had to go through this 
309,"But then on the flip side, if you wish to find positive in it, Shetty is coming of age. Better at what he is good at; i.e. doling out bad content. He is getting good at making pathetic content."
310,There was a bengali film called bhrantibilash based on this same storyline..
311,"Just by listening to the tone in this review, I can imagine this movie must have been so exhausting to watch.
Thank you Jammy."
312,"Hyy bro 
Have been sticking to your videos for a long.
The fact is we know that these movies are not worth watching at all n we already know by watching trailer,it’s going to be debacle."
313,"Somehow I wasted more than an hour listening to Rohit Shetty's gyan and arrogance over TRS podcast channel
Didn't know he was cooking this in the kitchen lol"
314,Well it was quite evident from the trailer itself that the movie is going to be a disaster! Especially when the trailer gives you glimpses of those greenish Ooty farms and extremely toyish sets. It was definitely a No Go for me.
315,And they say people troll Bollywood for no reason
316,"Hey jammy, sorry for the brain cells loss. Sending thoughts and prayers."
317,Pls make a review video on 18 PAGES & HIT 2 Telugu movies Jammy!
318,"Poor Anmol. We are sorry you had to endure this circus  but we love you!!! I knew this film was going to be a mess from the trailer fam. I don't think Ranveer is cut out for slapstick comedy whether it's a good script or not.
I also don't think Ranveer and Rohit are a good fit for each other at all. Ranveer is naturally over the top, he needs a director that can tame that for comedy and commercial films, not someone who will egg him on to do as he pleases because he always ends being a complete caricature."
319,Comedy and shouting are inversly proportional
320,These times of movies keep coming out of Bollywood. They never learn
321,"The physical comedy was good , it was a collections of mini skits , it was fun this movie shouldn't be analysed"
322,You saved my 3hrs of precious time
323,"Ah welcome to the UK! 
Have a great time! "
324,when are u going to give a review for TARA vs BILAL??
325,Jammy is constantly reminding us that he went to UK
326,"Please do the review of “The Legend of Mulla Jutt”, if you can…"
327,Why is it a compulsion to praise any veteran in bad movies? Sanjay mishra is good actor but his dialogues even from trailer killed my brain cells.
328,"Sometimes I do feel everyone is just praising rohit shetty for being the family entertaining director out of his continous box office movies.. par kya past laurels ko leke ek outdated kachre jaise banake, yeh comedy movie bolna kya Sachme sahi hai yeh hai Asli comedy . Rohit sir, do action, comedy sachme aap ke bas ki baat nhi hai"
329,"If nothing else, 2022 showed the difference between Rohith Shetty and Rishab Shetty"
330,Dude don't insult teletubbies. It is one of the greatest shows of all time.
331,"Bollywood is finishing a disastrous year with Cirkus.... lets hope ""Shani"" is over for bollywood "
332,"1:00:- Jammy.... Jali na Teri Jali na 

Rohit Shetty is the type of guy who will make you spend bucks for his movie even though you hate him... And that's a fact no matter how crass his movies have always been "
333,That’s really unfair to serve us with 2 matlab kuch bhi episodes in a single month
334,Pooja Hegde should seriously start considering item songs as a potential career path. She’s good for just that and nothing else in the industry and it’s easy money as well!
335,"And now rohit Shetty friends Will come and say Economic is at decline, people don't have the money to watch movie and when they will be saying this avatar will Cross 300cr target. Mene to ab Hollywood ki 1970 ki movie dekhna start kr diya"
336,ONLY SRK CAN SAVE BOLLYWOOD 
337,His grievance over spending 40 pounds on cab is the only reason this video was made
338,Bollywood movies nowadays can be described with just two words: 'forced' and 'fake'.
339,"Since you are in London, could you please watch and review ""The Legend of Maula Jatt? Peace and love from across the border."
340,"Hey...can you recommend a movie that I'll watch in one sitting because I have a thing that i can't watch a movie in one go,  even if the movie gets exciting still i can't watch without taking a break!!"
341,"What this movie needs is more brain eating zombies. — Christopher Moore"""
342,Rohit Shetty needed this. He was going Sajid Khan way. Rmbr how Sajid claimed Humshakals will break the BO.
343,Best film of The Decade...
344,3 back to back disasters for Ranveer. 
345,Angoor was such a good movie.
346,I have no sympathy for people who went to the theatre to watch this movie
347,"would've gone to watch it, just for pooja hegde
but seeing many reviews looks like it won't even be worth it for that"
348,"Pooja Hedge is on a roll here..beast, Radhe Shyam, Acharya and now this crap. She crossed a hat trick!"
349,Okay so seems like imma go watch an action hero again
350,"Yeh kab release hua,ott movie ?  NOT a pan INDIA may be local film
Edit:What a coincidence,mass Telugu director TEJA went out of business after FAMILY CIRCUS .Here shetty and co r out of stories "
351,"As a filmmaker, Rohit Shetty, Farah Khan, and Sajid Khan are triplets."
352,Bollywood on a roll.
353,Or u can say।।।Mr Shetty follow the foot step of bhai Sajid Khan 
354,"Not even gonna watch this on netflix or prime. Like lol what an end to 2022, good job to the cast."
355,Give your review on Decision to leave movie !
356,"Between this and hamshakaal, which would u rather watch?"
357,"Can Shetty join the leagues of Nolan Samji,Ahmed khan,prabhudeva, sajid khan,farah khan, will have to wait and see...the gems of Bollywood."
358,Don't these people watch there own movie before it's out!
359,That bandra to andheri comment says that jammy is definitely a kapil sharma fan
360,"Seeing how bad cirkus is actually hurts as a Rohit shetty fan myself, when I heard this is going to be a comedy film I was prepared to relive the fun I had when watching All the best, chennai express and the golmaal movies. The trailer disapointed me and seeing the reviews makes me skip a rohit shetty movie for the first time. I feel Rohit working with Farhad samji was what made this bad even the comedy in sooryavanshi was not to the rohit shetty standard thanks to Farhad Nolan Samji's Kadar khan like dialogues and Jeetu Joseph like intelligent writing(This is sarcasm tho). I do hope Rohit takes this as a lesson to be learnt"
361,I had negative expectations even from part of the trailer
362,At least nothing is stopping avatar 2 now
363,"Pls watch the Wednesday show and make a review video
Trust me it will act as a therapy !!!!!"
364,Intro of this video was much better than the movie itself
365,Bhai London me movie dekh ke mood kharab karna + paisa waste is next level sacrifice. +Respect jammy
366,Wait for 8 March to see the real comedy TJMM 
367,He also said my audience is not mass audience but families weather it works or not.
368,"Hey Jammy, please watch malayalam movie called Saudi vellaka and make a review."
369,"So was it jammy's wife who was saying, ""Aur sehn nhi hota mujhse?"" "
370,"Since you didn't like this film, it must be good. I will watch."
371,Haha savage af BRUTAL roasting in this review 
372,Post covid when the whole world is spoilt for choice with good cinema. How come rohit shetty thought this would work
373,This is why taurantino wants to quit after 10 movie. A director can get too comfortable with success and thinks that he can make any movie and it will sell. I personally like rohit Shetty. Even his most absurd movies still entertained but he really was overconfident with this project
374,"Its sad really that every month bollywood yearns a unicorn of a movie just to keep that sense of relevance in theatres, and in comes this movie which is a donkey with an icecream cone for a horn. Its just sad."
375,"Kamal has made movie called ""michel madana kama rajan"" 4 brothers separated at birth and reuniting is a laughter riot. Even if you watch it today its hilarious"
376,Rohit Shetty may have got cursh from Bandra to  Andheri public and specially who are holidaying in Europe right now 
377,Bollywood will spent crores on item numbers but can't hire a good script writer with that money.
378,Please pathaan Be good Bollywood really need a real GOOD MOVIE
379,"Yaar... Is movie ko troll matt kar... It's a very nice movie, I can able to sleep for 3 hours in spite of all the shor sharab around me... Think...in this competitive and mechanical life these are the movies that are helping us to have a pleasant sleep... Thanks for Rohit Sir... "
380,Hey Jammy. I want you to go and see the Telugu film 'Dhamaka' in the theaters and want you to compare these two films and why the former resonated with the masses so much and has become a blockbuster while 'Cirkus' failed miserably in that aspect.
381,It felt like someone poured hot petrol in your ear after watching this thing now I need to watch Kantara again to get my senses back.
382,It's sad to see comedy genre dying in bollywood. My only hope is hera pheri now.
383,"I didn't want to say this very early but now I want to say, I was afraid tht it wud turn out to be like humshakals"
384,Dukh hua na.. I felt the same pain after I watched bramhastra. Return my money!!
385,Surf excel ad was much better than the whole movie cinematography & vfx
386,sometimes u just know a film is going to be terrible. i knew as soon as i saw trailer.
387,After watching only the colour grading of it's trailer....i was sure this will be a disaster
388,You should watch Pitchers s2 soon
389,I m surprised there are even good aspects in this. 
390,Feeling bad for Ranveer. His next movie is Rocky aur Rani and I have a sinking feeling about that. Hope he can bounce back soon
391,Haven't seen any good movie with jacqueline in it. Recently felt the same about pooja hegde as well.
392,You can tell a lot about a movie from its trailer but sometimes it's proven wrong too but Im damn sure about some movies that they'll be shit! Like this one!
393,it would still make more sense than KGF and Kantara but you wont call them out
394,Bollywood destroyed this year 
395,Jammy when will u review Pitchers S02 ?
396,"When u see a literall ""colourful"" movie"
397,The poster itself gave me Humshakals flashbacks
398,"But,no one can do this role other than ranveer"
399,"I had already said in your first reaction video of the trailer for circus that Rohit shetty movies have declined rapidly in terms of Comedy and dialogue writing after Golmal 3 .
When I had watched the trailer itself , I couldn't see anything funny at all . Heck I was searching for a the jokes in it ."
400,Housefull movies are masterpieces infront of this
401,Mein to trailer ni pura dekh paya isne puru movie dekhli..
402,"No money, no watching movie in theatre "
403,"Since you are in London, would recommend you to watch The Legend of Maula Jatt and review.. pls pls"
404,Pooja Hegdes attitude like a Hollywood actress...but skills are like bhojpuri level 
405,Thanks jammy for sparing me the wrath of cirkus was supposed to go on new year with family I guess will have to make some other plan
406,Rohit shetty behaving like sajid khan 
407,I could only watch this movie for max 5 minutes on Netflix.
408,"You have money, time is not a limit, take as much or as less. You have the best writers, actors, technicians and support staff. You are already rich and famous, going around with who's who in Bollywood, tollywood etc...you have all the contacts in the world.
What stops you from making a good movie ? M not saying a great , outstanding or a masterpiece just a good movie ."
409,I felt like this is your shortest review ever
410,"I want to write about cirkus, but don't have the guts to watch it in theatres..."
411,"Hi

Kindly post review for Kappa (2022) & Vedha (2022)"
412,The legend of Farhad Samji....next with kisi ka Bhai kisi ki Jaan...
413,Even watching its review  feels headache.. but watching because of jammy
414,"This is a straight copy from 90s Tollywood movie of legendary actor Rajendra Prasad. The original movie is ""Ulta Palta"" which is available in Youtube and they just changed the screen-play a little "
415,I needed it while watching Brahmastra
416,When you started in hindi I thought I was watching a wrong video
417,Sajid Khan like confidence 
418,"Rohit Shetty's Humshakals! He needed the reality check, came too late imo."
419,With this film..Shetty sir needs to wake up and think..
420,"Ohh dear jammy, you what it feels like 'khudke pairo pe kulhadi maarna' sometimes, but you had go through such torture for us to not btw thnx love!"
421,Is it only me or does this movie resemble the 2004 Malayalam movie Vettam?
422,It was a good film I’ll put it above zameen golmaal2 all the best and Bol bachchan and the tribute to 90’s gvi films dilwale. Ultimately no one wants to accept the boycott trend.
423,After watching its trailer i would have not even watched it on OTT....u must have gone through a lot of pain while watching it as u had to review it then too..
424,Maybe because he does not suits in comedy character he can do period films perfectly  the most favourite performance is bajirao  the way he changed his voice he looked totally like Maratha warrior he already proved that he is amazing actor also Khilji the most iconic character   he can do cool dude and dark roll better than this stubborn character with lame dialogue I love his work in lootera Ramleela Dil dhadakne do befikre gully boy Simba and also 83 
425,Bollywood went down so bad I feel to come up strong they really need strong director and strong script...
426,Ranveer is not Ranbir and Rohit is not Rajkumar Hirani please don't forget
427,"Hey Jammy why don't you try Watching Masooda, a Telugu Horror Movie"
428,Bollywood needs to find someone other than Farhad samjo for comedy movies.. somebody tell him word puns are not funny
429,"Please watch new bengali movie called ""projapoti"" nd make a review..."
430,Jammy was so frustrated about the money he spent on this film .wasted a day of his foreign Trip.
431,"My real question is: was it worse than Humshakals, yes or no?"
432,Please watch and review MASSODA telugu horror movie. The best in recent times. Pant geele hogaye. Please.
433,I walked out of the theatre. Couldn't bear with it
434,"Watching the teaser you could see how bad this movie was going to be, which is such a shame I want Ranveer to take on Better roles and movies instead of taking the roles that make the most money each time. 
After seeing the trailer it was overwhelming how bad the dialogue was and how over the top the acting is. It just has no point as a movie, it’s not for anyone who uses their brain, this movie really does insult the audience"
435,"U know it's a bummer, when Jamy has to use the words ""'an iota of"" in the reviews. "
436,As expected...I knew it ... trailer says it all ...0% curiosity for this film...Mai toh OTT me free me dekh ke bhi time barbaad Naa Karu...
437,Ranvir Kapoor busy collecting Awards 
438,"I still can't understand that,  if you are good at something, you every product should come close to that standard, how come Bollywood fails so miserably.
Bollywood is the only place where standard deviation from the mean benchmark is way too much. "
439,(Rohit Shetty - humility) = Sajid Khan. Same movie making skills.
440,"You weren’t kidding about the saturation, my god, the thumbnail burnt my eyes"
441,"Please make a video on tara vs bilal 
It's now streaming on Netflix"
442,"Guys remember....these people take their audience for granted....
In the land of 100 cr people, is it really that hard to find a story ?? 

Movie makers need to taught a lesson"
443,Re-watch Qala to detoxify after this movie 
444,Thank u for wTching movie for us u did sacrifice for us 
445,Sajid Khan must be proud of Rohit shetty
446,This is not the first time that Rohit has delivered trash but this is the worse
447,For the same movie.. Kapil Sharma's show was more fun than this whole movie.. 
448,Cant believe Bollywood is doing this to pooja hedge. She is talented and very beautiful
449,Tell Tubby analogy though 🥹
450,Me with common sense : saw director name and Skip..
451,"How can you tell that a movie is going to enter the worst film list?
Ans.  Female cast - Jacqueline + 1"
452,Id rather watch legend ten times instead of this film 
453,What else were you expecting?
454,Bang on then it's a perfect Bollywood movie
455,Rohit shetty start making films like sajidh khan. This movie trailer just like humshkal as well
456,This movie seems like rohit shettys humshakals
457,Bro you have review the movie BLURR of taapse pannu please
458,I preferred Tvf pitchers over cirkusss ....
459,Watch decision to leave PLEASE ITS BEAUTIFUL
460,Please review the netflix series CAT
461,Rohit Shetty just took a leaf from Sajid Khan's book and burned down his library of excellence.
462,Jacqline aur katrina ki koi ek movie batao jaha ye dono ne acting ki hai ya acting ke liye jaani jaati hai.pata nahi kaise mil jaati hai film.
463,Hindi audience deserve This 
464,Fact: if Pooja Hegde is in the film...it's going to be bad!
465,"Most notably ""bhranti bilash"" 
Not ""Angoor"" 1:18"
466,The audience should be able to demand a full refund when a movie is this BAD!!
467,"Yes. Jammy even i noticed arrogance ego of rohit shetty in recent interviews and promotions. His thinking of only he can make a proper masala film, and he knows keys to trigger audience is going to ""lae dooba"" his films. His equations with comedy is clearly on wrong tracts after chennai express. Shouldn't say this but he really needed reality check of failure of cirkus, cause he needs to understand his funny or even farhad samji's writing is not freaking funny at all!!!!!!"
468,0 expectation from bollywood
469,Anmol bhai iss video ki script zyada funny thi Cirkus se 
470,you should watch legend of maula jutt while youre in UK
471,Whenever shetty is forced to make a film he does this …..
472,Me to Rohit Shetty:- Jao Jao tumhe maaf kiya
473,Jammy please make a review of Khakee the bihar chapter
474,Is it better than Humshakal or Himmatwala ???
475,Jammy please make a review of Khakee the bihar chapter
476,The plot is picked from Gulzar's Angoor
477,"Expecting anything sensible from Rohit Shetty means one has yet to understand cinema or basic filmmaking concepts. Everything he makes redefines the definition of crap and crass, taking the audience so much for granted that I am glad this didn't work."
478,Story was inspired from ala vaikunthapuramuloo 
479,Story was inspired from ala vaikunthapuramuloo 
480,"I knew it. 
The trailer gave me nausea."
481,Oh thank you for the review. I won’t waste my time and dollars on this movie… 
482,I just watched this movie. I developed a migraine.
483,It was a Judwaa 3 just with another title
484,"I get a feeling that Rohit Shetty will soon become like Manmohan Desai, when his formulas will no longer click with the new set of audience. He always made remakes, or showed the same action over and over again. He really needs to change other wise his next projects might face a similar fate like Cirkus. I think large portion of people don't even know about Cirkus, the promotion were very weak."
485,Bro is so flabbergasted with disappointment he started to speak hindi
486,Which one is better.. humshakaals or Cirkus? 
487,"Watch 18 pages(telugu movie). Very good love story.

#sukumar_writings"
488,For all the Paid reviews you did this year this was a sweet gesture for you by rohit shetty
489,i had same reaction for Brahmastra
490,Sir please watch Sanjay Mishra’s Vadh
491,Pooja Hegde is like Midas touch
492,Very rare maybe first time He started his video by speaking in Hindi.  
493,Bollywood needs therapy instead! All the actors are happy in this movie because they are being paid well!
494,Rohit Shetty can make even Khatron ke khiladi unwatchable. I can't imagine watching his films
495,I just came here to read all comments  Someone print and send this to RS
496,That intro scene from which film
497,"Well rohit shetty rot had begun a few years back it was just that nobody noticed coz everytime a radhe or race 3 had set the bar lower so somehow his movies sailed.
Golmaal 4 was not quite upto the mark n sooryavanshi was also over rated."
498,"They could have made it meaningfully funny, but instead they made this shit. Can't say I'm surprised after the trailer tho. Just why Ranveer why? After so many amazing performances, why this?"
499,This is Rohit Shetty humshakals 
500,"Sorry you had to through this shit for us !
Wish i could send you some mulled wine and plum cake ! ️
Now please have a good Christmas! Merry Christmas ! ️"
501,There goes 2022..and nothing to mention other than brahmastra and drishyam
502,Oh god....now Ranveer is gonna go broke buying more awards.
503,The fact that the trailer was being sold on the Deepika and Golmaal 1 factor was enough for me to know that the movie is going to be terrible
504,Yes the movie was bad but this review was straightforward and brutal 
505,And it’s budget is more than Kgf 2  they think no value for money neither theirs nor ours ️️️
506,Never watched a Rohit Shetty film in my life
507,"Just to add a vital information in your video the 1963 bengali movie Bhranti Bilash starring Super star Uttam Kumar, Shabitri Chatterjee, Bhanu Bandopadhyay, Sandhya Roy and several others adapted from the drama written by Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar originally based on William Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors. This movie was a jewel of its time later on copied by film director Gulzar as Angoor which in my opinion is a very cheap version of the original Bengali movie."
508,"Did this film burst the bubble of some who were calling Ranveer Singh the MOST versatile actor who can magically turn everything he touched into gold? Tbvh, the dude has only shined with SLB and in Lootera."
509,Hi anmol .. pls review knives out .. glass onion 
510,shirish kunder aur sajid khan ke level ki movie bana di Rohit Shetty ne is baar
511,Welcome to Gloomy London!! Pls do a fan meetup 
512,"Pooja Hegde has 4 disasters in 3 languages this year
Radhe shyam - Telugu
Acharya - Telugu
Beast - Tamil"
513,4:33 Rohit Shetty does consider his audience to be absolutely dumb because which smart person would watch this movie by choice?
514,Please review pitchers 2
515,Comments Under this video is more Sensible than whole film ..........
516,"Bro if u r in UK,I would like to meet you I know it is farfetched but it's holiday season so I am just throwing it out there."
517,Irony of Rohit shetty who said south industry is over dramatic too many illogical fight scenes and masala when his own movie is totally garbage
518,Sir dard de dia cirkus... ️
519,The promotions fooled a lot
520,"BREAKING:
#TheLegendOfMaulaJatt Is Now Confirmed To Release In India On 30th December’22.make video"
521,Nowadays trailer itself reveals how movie is going to be . Comedy in Trailer itself looked exaggerated
522,I don't know why in the first place they made this film
523,"So like are we seeing the pattern here,,,any movie with pooja have been a major disaster,be it south or north or whatever.
It's just sad"
524,I have said this before. The whole Bollywood will tank soon.Period.
525,Was it a tribute to sajid khan?
526,Comedy to he bhai movie ke Har reviews me Comedy horahihe 
527,The guy who made fun of Hindi filmmakers ended year with biggest mockery of same industry.
528,This failure hopefully teach a lesson to the arrogance and attitude of Rohit chetty and Ranvir Singh 
529,"Even in 80s films were good enough. Atleast conept were equal to the time.  
Who looks after this twins separated at birth and looks exactly copy of each other.  Even real twins wont be same"
530,Bollywood movie making is safe for Blackmoney
531,"I don't know why they want to put us in a barricade 1st KarenaKK says forest gumps for class now Rohit Shetty it's for mass...
I can't speak English,a girl from bengali medium, my knowledge in this language is only for exam purposes..."
532,Self proclaimed Bollywood heros 
533,The biggest problem is they are so greedy for money is they rush and make any slap dash movie with no substance lol its like the world is ending for them and they just want to throw these stupid movies at the audience.
534,watch angoor. legendary film. really good
535,Judwaa meets humshakals
536,At least you can watch TVF Pitchers Season 2 to get some therapy.
537,Sometimes I do really wonder whether these directors even watch their own films in the first place. How on the earth can they make such a crass movie. It is an absolute disgrace to the cult movie like angoor.
538,I am surprised at those folks who expect anything better than this from Mr. Rohit rubbish Shetty!
539,It is Rohit and Ranveer who need therapy.. they’re deluded for sure.
540,I never really like the Golmaal series except the 1st one. I feel all of Rohit Shetty's movies have the same kind of vibe and feel and specially the music. Can't tell 1 movie beat from the other
541,Wasn't ready for jamy starting with hindi
542,Why he had to remake Humshakals
543,Yes Man Culture kabhi khatam nahi hoga Jammy...
544,"Just watch ""Govinda Naam mera"" a way better comedy movie."
545,May be Ranvir Singh has lost confidence in acting
546,"Jammy bhai ko , Bandra to Andheri waale baat ka bhaut hurt hua hain "
547,He lost old era Eastman color with more saturation
548,Ok.. choose one.. Humshakals or Cirkus?
549,Is it worst than liger?
550,We get it Jammy. You're in London. Damn!
551,आपका धन्यवाद भाइ आपकी बझे से हम बच गए।
552,"Strong contender for ""Ghanta Awards"" 2022"
553,you are sounding under the weather jammy. get well soon bro
554,They are just trying to recreate the impact comedy films from 2001-2009 had. But they really suck and are too ignorant to understand what mass want right now.
555,Pls review pitchers s2
556,"3:38  Gopal, Madhav ,Laxman,  Lucky"
557,Why did you upload the 1.25x speed video or did you record it in the London tube coming back from the movie?
558,Trust your opinion and will only watch on OTT
559,the review is funnier than the movie
560,"After watching the trailer I knew this is gonna be Rohit Shetty's worst film ever, slapstick comedy tak thik tha, this is like slapping with a chappal on the target audiences' intellect "
561,Thumbnail cracked me up.
562,"Review ""Masooda"". It's on Aha"
563,Review 'CAT' please!
564,They shouldn't have bothered with shooting this movie. They should have just acted it out for fun and for personal viewing on their cellphones. It's okay to have a big expensive party because they can afford it. Need not damage people's braincells for their entertainment.
565,"I think Jammy took that bandra to Andheri diss rather too personally. Yes, he does fir perfectly in that character discription but koi nai, sach kadva hota hai thoda. Yes the movie is bad but you don't have to be that offended bro."
566,The movie was so bad that it felt good
567,Even all the best was a below avg movie but Sanjay Mishra was the saving.grace
568,Jo bhi dekhne jaane wala hai jarur dekho circus 
569,It's  sad to see  sajid khan all over again
570,Now ranbirs wife will revive ranveers  career  
571,Bro i watched cirkus for me the climax was bad and the movie lacked in comedy  but i have seen worst movies than CIRKUS so it was not that bad
572,"The audacity of Rohit Shetty to lure Hindi public to watch this crap is insane. I mean he know what he is serving to already ""upset from Bollywood"" Hindi belt yet he is  using all those emotional speeches of how Bollywood made legendary movies like sholay, mother India and what not ! It is again a reminder that Bollywood needs to come out of its stardombased  utopian cocoon and make some real life based movies, with which maximum of india can relate! + Wtf is this "
573,"Review latthi , connect tamil movie ."
574,God Bollywood is  going down bad
575,Just say It's a Shetty Movie
576,There are movies. And then there is kachra that's made for middle class who work 50+ hours/week and just want to watch something with their family at the end of it. Rohit shitty is the master of making the latter.
577,This felt like poking fun of a real story .... the triplets who were separated for researching nature vs nurture... watching the documentary three identical strangers is better utilization of time than this bs.
578,"omg, when r they going to stop Farhad Samji from writing scripts!!!!
He is the Arjun kapoor of writing. Is he from nepotism or what?
We went from Neeraj Vohra to Farhad Samji, r there no other comedy writers in bollywood"
579,more like multiverse of sadness
580,"so finally, here's a Ranveer Singh movie i am not at all interested in watching!"
581,"Watching your Video 1st time, and Felt like u are reading a long paragraph "
582,Excellent review
583,Arrogance always leads to the down fall.
584,"Firstly I cant get over that u paid £40 in cab! The cabbie mustv thought this guy ain't a clue cheeky sod! Leli teri uske, secondly everything u said about the movie I predicted from watching the trailer when everyone in the comments were saying 'super hit bro, kya mast, oh baap re baap  deepika' maybe being in my late 30s I can smell crap from a far, not sure what brought u to UK in the cold but enjoy winter wonderland and get home safely, great review."
585,Don't know what director and producer gets from Jacqueline so they cast expression less actress
586,Shuru me to laga ki waaa aaj hindi me .. then sudden bbc started ..
587,Comedy left Bollywood!
588,Better to watch Royal Indian Cirkus
589,Something finally that can beat humshakal..
590,"Okay we get it Jammy, you went to London!"
591,"3:27 ha maine bhi trailer dekh kar yhi socha, why such edit"
592,Please cat review why you are ignoring it review it already
593,"Well forget about the movie, but welcome to London Fam"
594,Review cat webseries of randeep hooda.........
595,After this even pathaan gonna become a big disaster it's good to be fair this will make this lazy people take us seriously they dump anything in the name of a movie because they think we will watch anything
596,Ofcourse Ranveer was off because he knew while shooting that this movie is also going to be a flop!!! I have done few short films and with my experience i can say actors can actually predict while shooting what a trainwreck the end product is going to be....
597,Neither Ss Rajamouli  nor Raju Hirani take audiance for granted bt Rohit Shetty did...nd the end result is CRAP ND TATTI... 
598,Black money ko white kar re Bollywood wale aajkal
599,For Ranveer comedy means overacting
600,You will actually loose brain cells watching this
601,Was watching recent rohit shetty interviews! So much overconfidence
602,Deepika panoti for ranveer first 83 and now circus
603,"Pooja Hegde went on with Salman and like many has lost her mind 
Bollywood has always been shit i just have identity crisis now a days why was i doing such thi g instead read books and played chess"
604,The green grass has Teletubby vibes.... Maybe that was their target audience..... 
605,"Most out dated director is Rohith shetty he still think like 80s logics in movies. If the ott not came to India this horrible bollywood stories will collect 200 crore sure .
Because of explore in ott flatform audience knows how rohith shetty south kichidi is mixed with north masala ."
606,"There should be a separate section for Rohit Shetty's movies....""Garbage"""
607,"I dont want to see the film so some one can tell me what is the connection with
 golmaal in this movie"
608,Jammy bro i do appreciate ur reviews. Par yeah is film me hasi toh aa rhi hai jahan tak mai dekh rha hun. So bad that it's good wale catogory me aa rha hai
609,Saturation Pro Max!’ 
610,"10 sec into the trailer I knew this is going to be a shitshow ..

PS: and what's up with all the sets are we living in 1960s ? did rohit shetty forgot that he can use cgi and vfx ?"
611,Cirkus made clown of people who bought tickets 
612,I think heropanti 2 was better than cirkus 
613,"Usse achchha Bankelal comics padh lo. It has blatant hee hee hee written in places like a laugh track, but it will be funny... Unlike Cirkus"
614,"When some want to make their black money white , they make a movie"
615,Rohit Shitty is becoming next version of Sajid khan....he is walking on same path....
616,Tellytubbies episode  has less editing
617,And i was thinking that  dilwale was only the crap created by RS
618,Double roles are very overrated now we don't wanna see more of double roles finger are still crossed because the audience can change the lifetime bizz of #cirkus
619,Paisa bachao and help the unprivileged one's...
620,Halo.. How could you expect RS to make inelegant movie at all!!?
621,Bad year for Pooja 
622,Your tone dictates the frustration for this movie 
623,I just feel bad for @jammy yar...  He just doesn't want to do the review at all. His voice in the end is so plain that he just wants to get done with it.
624,Rohit shetty bhai ko zyada gamand agaya hai sochra hai har film chalegi iskii
625,Telletuby episode 
626,Respect for you
627,I want to know the name of casting director....jacqueline uski behan hai kya jo cast kiaa....
628,I pity the people who watched the movie despite the horrible trailer 
629,"It's disturbing to see how the failures of all four films starring Pooja Hegde, this year, are being attributed to her in the comments. If they were hits, would you give her the credit for it? #justasking"
630,"The trailer was shi**y so I saw it was coming. Ranveer Singh's acting is bery loud on screen adn Sanjay Mishra is an actor who is actually watchable, he is one of my favourite actors."
631,"Angoor is much much better ,please watch it ,it has much much more good comedy than Cirkus,only positive in this movie is Sanjay Mishra comedy ,he has just nailed it ,what a brilliant comic timing"
632,And look at the RS speeches supporting qnd making comments that Bollywood is superior than other industries instead of calling 1 Indian film industry..he himself does all Telugu and South movie remakes!!
633,"Monice o my darling,Qala, Govinda naam mera should have been released in theatre esp Qala that masterpiece was theatre worthy while this crap is not evn you tube worthy.."
634,"With the kind of films over the past 3-5 years, i wonder if Bollywood will even exist in the near future.
Lack of originality, cringe content and humor, copying films from other parts of the country/world and remaking it, pathetic remakes, favouritism leading to compromising of talent in key movies & roles etc and the list goes on."
635,No one is talking about Vadh
636,Rohit shetty very chalak bro..turning black money to white with such craps 
637,Multiverse of madness
638,00:01 I already decided not to watch after watching this
639,"Justice for Sushant Singh Rajput 
Boycott Jihadi Bollywood forever 
Support Vivek Agnihotri 
Support Kangana Ranaut"
640,"Tip - the more marketing a film requires, the worse it is."
641,Ranveer Singh another imran khan??
642,"did anyone else notice, how he conveniently delays reviewing some movies?"
643,I hope cirkus flops and atlast rohit shetty will be able to see the real scenario of his so called sure shot hit formulae ! RS needs to go back to original golmaal and his first movie zameen
644,Trailer itself was disaster 
645,"Rohit Shetty made his living by remaking old hindi films or south movies but with circus he couldn't even do that properly. 
Now he is saying abhi mein Singham banayega, patha nehi uska kya hoga ab."
646,Your review only depressed me  Can't even think of watching the movie.
647,Why these days u r not uploading dance videos jammy???
648,Why jamy is offended by bandra to andheri talk
649,Most notably in Bhrantibilash
650,"But dude how can you even decide to go watch this film, I mean don't you see the trailers and get an idea from those that how cringe these kinds of films will turn out to be. ️"
651,Review pitchers2 plz
652,Rohit Shetty was defending Bollywood.... Just like Pakistan PM boasting about his country... 
653,Rohith Shetty and Sajid Khan are competing - who will deliver the biggest tatti in their career! 
654,"Industry is wasting the talent like Ranveer singh has, only Sanjay leela Bansali has understood the right talent of him and gave him career best movies like Bajirao and Padmawat.. And after that no  are able to showcase his talent in a right way.. He is a real live wire and such a poor direction from rohit shetty.."
655,Rohit Shitty’s masterpiece
656,"I always wonder how Golmal 2/3/4 gets superhit 
That means this film is too bad 
And badluck of bollywood continues..."
657,The audio is kinda too fast in this video
658,What was Ranvir thinking when he signed this garbage?!
659,Masooda review available in aha platform
660,I was saying this to my friends about Sajid Khan and Rohit Shetty that both of them aren't good directors or storytellers. But i was always slammed for being stupid and called intellectual  start from Zameen and see even Sunday and obviously most of other movies I liked Sunday but didn't like Golmal and the way he was hashing same thing in name of sequals 
661,Bollywood
662,Filmfare is film ke liye ranveer singh ko sammanit na kr de
663,Rohit Shetty aur Ranvir Singh ko gumaan hogya hai ke wo mitti me bhi haath daalenge to Sona niklega ?
664,Ouch. I feel you bro. Wasting two hours of your vacation time on this shit.
665,Where is Tvf pitcher series review
666,I saw worst already in the trailer..
667,Rohit Shetty never sounded arrogant.  He never said or meant in any of his interviews that he is invincible. That's again an inaccurate narrative based out of your own judgement. It seems like you were waiting for this failure to happen. Movie may have been a flop but not because of his arrogance or overconfidence but rather the content.
668,Remake king rohit shetty 
669,Rohit shetty adapting Shakespeare play is the joke of the century.
670,Is there any comparison to how bad it is with Akshay Kumar joker 
671,This will still make 100 crores without logic and hero fame
672,Samajh nahi aata ye Farhad Samji ko kaam kaise mil jata hai 
673,Thanks for enduring the torture to save us the terror.
674,Even ghatiya word is not enough for this ghatiya film. They think audience are stupid
675,Okayyy thanks for saving my money 
676,Cirkus is a remake of kannada movie ulta palta which is even remade into Telugu with same name
677,tell me honestly what the fck is there to be watching and enjoying in London for a Holiday
678,️-dey ka star of the decade
679,Rohit had hits only with remakes
680,Ppl pay hard earned money to fund Lavish lifestyle of stars
681,Kudos to bravery of people who went to see this crap after the trailer !!!!!
682,"Yes Jammy, we got it. You're in London"
683,Yall dissing Pooja Hegde for her film choices but no one is noticing the absolutely bonkers streak Jackandlean is on
684,I m glad I didn't even watch it..
685,"Ranveers career is over.... Period
It's a modified version of Sanjeev Kumar deven Verma starrer... angoor...imagine a gulzaar film being postmortemed"
686,"""Angoor"" was a better movie inspite."
687,I have said earlier.....yeh Rohit Shetty ki over confidence saaab ko marey ga and ranveer singh should stop trying to do comedy woh us ki baat kaab nahi tha
688,"Man, you should not have watched this movie. The trailer said it all in its full glory. This kind of crap must be avoided at all costs."

690,glass onion save me 
691,Rohit shetty ka overconfidence kha gya
692,Wr z bollywood going with this crap. Hw r they making money with it. Thoda masala kam kr do fr gods sake
693,"0:03 
Which BGM is this  ???"
694,Uttar Gaya Rohit Shetty movies ka bukhaar !
695,Now Tried and Refused productions is too big for small budget movie like Vadh. Even Sanjay Mishra would have asked you to watch Vadh and not Circus.
696,"I genuinely want to ignore the fact, that you are on a holiday in UK and you decided to watch Rohit Shetty film there. You are much better than this Jammy"
697,"check out

701,"Just watched the movie....... There is a 1997 kannada movie named 'Ulta Palta' which was adapted from the same book which cirkus is adapted from, and that kannada movie was much much better and funnier. Cirkus is a mess from start to end."
702,This movie is a senseless saga of shamelessness by Rohit Shetty.
703,"As much,  I didn't enjoy watching Angoor, I don't seem to have any hope in this movie..."
704,I already knew that.. It would be career flop of Rohit Shetty

712,"Bruhh, and some reviews were actually praising this movie. I mean when Sajid Nadiawala is a part of a movie, how can it not be anything but crap?"
713,I hav never liked any of Shetty movies n Rohit shettys interviews time n again prove his arrogance and also his show khatron ke Khiladi u can see his arrogance

727,Yes he was so overconfident
728,"Dude, spend the money for something good, maybe go for spa  or if there's Lion King on Broadway, watch that "
729,Rohit Shetty taking audience as granted....last movie is Singham returns where I really enjoyed his direction but after that Golmaal 4 is lack in comedy and Suryavanshi is also too stretchy with bad screenplay......and from the trailer Cirkus look very poor....I think Rohit Shetty think that's he make anything and people's are so stupid to spend their hard earned bucks and buy tickets to watch movies like Cirkus

The movie is not worthy for this short review also"
735,Man those 40 quid.
736,Umm. This voice .. it's very Ranveer like 
737,"If a movie has Pooja Hegde in it, it's a clear sign fr me to avoid it. ️ she has a knack of selecting the most disastrous projects. Hope she comes out of her comfort zone soon."
738,"I know that movie is not good but the way you review its look like you have some personal problem with rohit shetty....
We need review for reviewer (critics)"
739,Aur sehen nahi hota mujhse 
740,"London, thanks for letting us know you are here....ho gaya bhai kitni bar bolega, pata chalgaya"
