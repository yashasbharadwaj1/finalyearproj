Saw it last night. Aside from what people think of the story and visuals, I felt this was a passion project. Cameron brought his love for science fiction, nature and film making together. I was pleased.

The story was predictable, but the scenes were pure art.  The amount of time put into the visuals and details is mind blowing.

As a son from a military family with a military Dad, the family dynamic is the exact family dynamic I had growing up. The way Sully would get so angry out of love, but not even realize where his anger was coming from was done perfectly. Sully isn't perfect and his dynamic with his family isn't perfect, even though he's trying his best

I totally see what Chris meant by not being able to get a read on Spider. It was super jarring seeing him chilling and being bros with the enemy, then doing a bunch of switcheroos. His conflicting loyalties needed to be built more organically over the course of the film.

I think what they wanted to with Spider was show how he is conflicted. He wants to connect with this new father figure who is the closest he‚Äôll get to the real thing, so he even begrudgingly helps him. But he still loves his adoptive family and the Na‚Äôvi people and helps them when he can. He‚Äôs like Jake Sully, a person who is in-between two planets. It was (relatively) easy for Jake to make the choice between earth and Pandora when he had nobody (It was just Jake and his deceased twin brother), but now Spider sees he could have a future with the humans. I would‚Äôve liked to see more interaction and tempting of Spider, like the humans offering  him a chance to have an avatar and be a medium between the two or as just another soldier. Someone who could conquer the Na‚Äôvi but in a more ‚Äúhumanitarian‚Äù way as he earns their respect and knows their ways. We‚Äôll see how the sequels turns out, I‚Äôm already excited and hope it comes soon.

The length of this movie makes it possible to really get to know all the character and that gives the action a lot of weight. Simple plot, but beautifully put together in all facets of movie-crafting.

I think the story in the first Avatar was really simple but the world was so rich and that‚Äôs what made it engaging, seeing how the Na‚Äôvi interact with nature and think about spirituality is what makes that movie impactful. The way James Cameron uses visuals to emphasize the themes in a powerful way is awesome

Well worth the wait. I have no doubt Avatar will do what it needs to do over Christmas weekend and beyond. I saw it today and I've got two more showings booked this week. I'll be booking more showings during and after Christmas as well. I'm positive others will also go out of their way to see and experience this movie in 3D. I got chills watching it. It was such a visceral and emotional experience.

Apparently Cameron admitted in an interview that he kept plot simple so a huge audience can enjoy the visual spectacle without being too distracted by intricate story-writing. 

So if this movie satisfies him with it's market performance, he might be focussing on more creative plot line, though I believe the scripts for the sequels are already written.

One thing you should notice watching this absolute masterpiece of a movie is how Cameron uses depth. Its a 3 hour movie. And it seems almost EVERY scene is layered. So many layers. Characters, doodads, plants, animals....layer upon layer to create depth EVERYWHERE....its absolutely amazing to look at. The effects themselves are out of this world, but the sheer amount of work that must have gone into filming this and planning the shots, I have simply no idea how this movie is humanly possible. Once you start noticing the depth, its impossible not to. Its EVERYWHERE. And it is absolutely fantastic.

What I got from the Spider character was that he didn‚Äôt know who he was supposed to be. He wasn‚Äôt fully accepted by the Naveen and when he was taken and tortured there were no attempts to rescue him.  Sully fled with his family and the Naveen went on with their lives as usual. At least the Colonel threw him some sort of lifeline and showed some love and compassion.

This is definitely a film you need to watch a few times. It's just so dense. And of course visually breathtaking. I wasn't blown away by the story or dialogue, but it's easy to forgive when you see this magic on screen. And it is magic. It made me feel like being a 5 year old again and seeing the batmobile for the first time. Or 2 years later seeing a metal man, a helicopter fly through a bridge, Arnie surfing a crashing tanker truck...even the first Avatar didn't bring me back to that child like feeling.

You hit the nail on the head with how they make these movies more agreeable for the general audience. Just look at how he did Titanic. At its base, it's a simple Romeo and Juliet story more or less with an action movie going on in the background.

I've seen this with my big sister in IMAX 3D. I didn't realize how the frame rates were when we started watching the movie, especially in 3D. We get to know more about the characters, and there's a Na'vi sign language we know. The creators of Avatar, and Cameron, always does a good job with the graphics, visuals, stories, and character designs. I look forward to watching it on Disney+ soon!

I totally understand Spider's motivation and internal conflict. I think how he feels is similar to how Kitty feels; that yearning, curiosity and grief. The difference is that there's also anger in him whereas Kitty's is all love. He flips back and forth because there's this test of loyalty between his biology vs what truly encompasses family. The conflict is more evident towards the end but I felt his conflict and grief throughout the entire movie. I think his character will only develop more as the series continues...at least I hope anyway.

I think Spider was a pretty clear character
He's grown up with the Na'vi and the few remaining Humans who sided with them in the original movie
He's taken by the recoms to the new settlement where he bonds a little bit with quaritch enough to at least not want him to die by the end, even if he was disgusted with what he was doing

There was a little girl with her family sitting almost directly in front of me in the theater, about 5 or 6, and she was crying with some scenes featuring the ocean wildlife in this movie. This is the sort of experience I like about these movies so much. They're made with so much care, they seem so real yet fantastical, I can imagine how little kids will grow up and relish the memories of watching this in theaters, and maybe even fall in love with film, by watching movies like Avatar The Way of Water. I freaking loved this movie.

I think part of the reason why Cameron is keeping these movies' themes and plot so simple it‚Äôs because he is thinking about a global audience, so universal themes like family will resonate, people can shit on him all they want but if they were managing a movie at this scale they probably do the same.

I never got bored of the humans in Avatar 1. It would be even better with the deleted scenes (obviously). I loved the boss, even if he is considered a cliche, but is given more life in deleted scenes, I loved the colonel, that's why I'm happy they didn't kill him off in this new one. The whole son father dynamic between him and Spyder is a great addition. I was actually cheering on the him on in his fight with Sully. I wasn't sure if James would kill him off like in the first film. Either way, great movie.

I loved Spiders character. As stated he was a stray dog. Calling home a place that can kill him within minutes just by breathing. He is the weakest within his chosen people. He is dragged by fate and left by few choices.
I also really loved the troubled father-son dinamics. Quaritch is one of my favorite character. He is not purely a warmongering maniac, but troubled by his past life memories.

I think spyder‚Äôs motive is left ambiguous throughout the film because of the sequel. I think a lot more questions will be answered in the sequel, but also believe that he could act as a possible bridge between the Na‚Äôvi and the sky people, especially quaritch. I hypothesise that Spyder will be able to complete what Jake was unable to do in the first film and create unity between humans and na‚Äôvi in Pandora. Or if that is not the case, a complete side switch to the sky people and will end up being a battle between the two protagonist and antagonist‚Äôs sons, almost as like a ‚Äúwho can carry the legacy and remain on top‚Äù

I think that when they were scanning Spider‚Äôs brain they were also putting subtle sleeper agent stuff into his mind too. I think he was reprogrammed to protect his ‚Äúfather‚Äù and that‚Äôs why he pulled him out of the water. Maybe they also put something in him that would trigger and make him kill Jake while he has his guard down one day.

I saw spider's flip flopping as a product of him still being a kid and being torn between helping his (spoiler) father and his adopted family. He also wanted to save his own skin, so his actions reflected that - maybe it could stem from his always being somewhat left out leading to a desire to fit in wherever he finds himself.

Regarding Spider: I really liked how wishy-washy the character is. He is a kid who was raised in a family where he doesn‚Äôt fit in. His biological dad was demonized by his community for as long as he has known and he bought into that. He meets that father who disowns him at first. Throughout the movie he is torn between his community and family that raised him and the biological connection he has to his father. Of course he is going to make illogical and inconsistent decisions. The boy doesn‚Äôt yet know who he is. The whole plot of the movie, from his perspective, is an identity crisis.

You were right on every point. I saw it in IMAX 3D with HFR (high frame rate). And it was a truly awesome experience. I will see it a second time - but this time I want to try the Screen X version. No, the movie isn't perfect, but not once was I left gasping at any waste of money - cause it's all visible. Yes, the story is easy to follow in that the good is all good, and the villains are truly hissable. Yes, it takes a little time to establish things, but hell, I'm encouraging people to see it.

I watched it and loved it. Even over time I feel myself drawn to that world. I am still floored by Sigourney Weaver's performance as Kiri. I still don't believe that was her. However, if it hadn't been shot in IMAX I wouldn't have bothered seeing it in the theater. It takes me a lot these days to go to the theater. I have 4K HD at home and there are a lot of movies that look better at home than they do at the movies. Avatar isn't one of them. It has to be seen in the theater, in IMAX. It's the same with Top Gun: Maverick. As soon as they announced that it was shot in IMAX I knew I had to see in the theater. Did Avatar have to be 3D? Maybe. I am not bothered by 3D especially when it's done right. Avatar is definitely an IP that knows how to use 3D.

Simple stories aren't a bad thing. Too many movies these days have these bloated casts with little to nothing for many of the characters to do, there are too many subplots that do go anywhere, and plot and character development take a backseat to explosions and CGI. Keeping things focused means you can really invest in the characters and make sure the plot is fleshed out.

I wasn't as enamored with the first Avatar as everyone else, but I felt Way of Water was a much better film. Mileage will certainly vary, but I really enjoyed WoW's dedication to character development and making its really simple story work. I wasn't annoyed by the teen characters in the ways I would've been annoyed by them in other films and that was huge for me.

Fantastic review, I agree with almost everything you said. I'm regards to the first hour, I was so happy that Cameron let the movie breath and took its time showing the viewer the daily lives of the new clan. It felt like that section shouldve dragged, but I was just in awe of the visuals on the whole time. It was just so calm and peaceful and really helped to flesh out the world by showing the culturual and evolutionary differences between the different Navi. It woukdve been simpler to make this section more montagey,  but I found it so effective that they slowed the film down and immersed the viewer in this new world.

Hey Chris, big fan of the channel been watching your vids for years.  By far my favorite movie reviewer out there.  While I do agree there is a message about saving the forest in Avatar 1, and saving the oceans in Avatar 2, I do think its goes much DEEPER than that.  Eywa is a large part of the meaning, it's the spiritual bond we have with nature and the earth itself.  Caring for the environment, ya sure, but realizing you are a living breathing part of the environment, we are all part of the one.  Kiri was a great example because she was suppose to be un-pure, but she showed to have one of the strongest connections with Eywa, it doesn't matter what you are it matters who you are and who you choose to be.  James is trying to get us to remember who we are.

So funny - my reaction was the opposite.  The first half blew me away, I could have sat in a theater and watched it for hours.  Second half - Oh, they're fighting now.  I completely checked out.  It actually felt like I was watching the second half of Titanic.   I would totally pay to go see it in a really good 3D theater - but I would leave once the fighting starts and feel satisfied with the money spent.

I really enjoyed the movie. A visual feast indeed. I was thorougly entertained. However I did find the ocean scenery after a bit grew a little tedious and well, a bit boring. It was very cool at first, seeing underwater, etc, but after awhile, I wanted them to go back to the forrest that had so many cool things in it landscape wise, trees, giant trees, moutains, so many creatures. Or at least travel on to explore more of Pandora. I hope in the next one, its not ALL on the same Island. But still a great movie overall for me. YetI can totally see peoples issues with it 100%. But for me, it didnt kill the movie experience/

I first saw it in IMAX 3D at 24 fps and it looked really good seeing it at a larger format and the 3D was just constantly popping throughout the movie without making it in your face. And I also watched it a second time in RealD 3D at 48 fps which really open my eyes to me it helped the 3D feel more accessible it felt very smooth and made the action sequences and visuals look eye candy it's pretty surreal watching a movie with such high frame rate since I'm used to watching movies and TV shows at 24 fps but 48 fps just blew my mind. It may seem like old news for anyone who watched a movie at a higher frame rate like The Hobbit Trilogy or Gemini Man and that people are mixed by it but for my first time experiencing it felt like a game changer.

I think with Spider there was a little bit of ""doesn't matter if your dad is a killer he's still your dad"" going on.  So Spider was conflicted and even he didn't know which side he should pick.

I went to see it yesterday, December the 27th with my two kids, we love the first one,  my one daughter was too young to see the first one when it came out but I thought James Cameron was not going to be able to come anywhere near close the first one, I wouldn't say it's better than the first one but I would say out of 10,  I would give it at least a 9-9 1/2. I thoroughly enjoyed it I definitely would watch it again. I saw it in 3D, I might go and see it again on IMAX but, I highly would recommend it. Best film I've seen all year.. and because everybody was blue I thought it would have had difficulty identifying the bad guy, but it wasn't difficult identifying the bad people at all. And to have a villain that brilliant, if anyone wants to make a movie and they want to have a villain it doesn't get any better than the villain in this film. And the people who are not very nice you have a sense of Joy when they comeuppance happens. I think James Cameron will top three billion dollars with this simply because to watch it on 3D costs a little bit more to watch on this format and I'll be surprised if anyone really wants to watch it on 2D but be prepared to be yet again visually Blown Away and emotionally Blown Away

Amazing film. Definitely going to see it again. I went in skeptical. Instead was blown away. Even more beautiful than the first film. You're constantly asking ""how?"" As to the story, it's not much more complex than the first film's, though there are more characters and themes about family in it. But you know what, that's all you need for something like this. Strong recommend.

But with Avatar, I was very underwhelmed in contrast to its hype at the time and like you said, I had to painstakenly endure the 3D hype that ensued.

This film is utterly astonishing.  The visuals are way beyond what the original achieved.  The action sequences are masterfully constructed--to such a degree of precision that is simply mind-boggling.  And you know,--the story and dialogue are just fine.  It does what it needs to do, and so much more.  I guess my only gripe is that once Jake--as the war chief--is essentially hunted into exile, he's no longer a real threat to human interests.  The human forces could have just let up at that point and proceeded directly to exploiting the planet.  But the scope we're given into the value of Pandora and why humans are truly there, really flesh out just how precious ""The Balance"" is on Pandora.  It's the true stuff of dreams: biological access to our ancestors in a mediated afterlife through a free, planetary network.  A religion with true merit.  I for one can't remember the last time I saw a movie this enthralling.  I absolutely loved the methodical pace of the first act.  The film is genuinely touching and authentic in a way none of his other stories are.

I never questioned Spider‚Äôs motivations. He was left with few options. At every opportunity he chose the Na‚Äôvi. In the end he makes a decision that comes out of compassion. He‚Äôs along for a ride that he‚Äôs not in control of but I never felt conflicted about his motivations. Where we go for here, not sure but his arc was clear to me.

I thought Spider's motivations were clear. He is a Na'vi, loves his adopted family and his home in Pandora. His ""helping"" of the bad guys is essentially forced in the first case and indirect in the second (I think just showing that he's kind and compassionate, unlike his biological father).

I had a lot of problems with the story. I felt like the message at the end was strange as basically ""use violence to protect your family"". I thought the big action scene at the end went on too long, and I was kinda disturbed that the Navi were murdering all of these average Joe's on the ship. Kitty has a moment where she crushes a submarine and as the guy is swimming up to the surface to breathe she grabs him and presumably drowns him. I didn't like that the film felt like time wasted until Jake finally decided to stay and fight. It made me laugh when at the end he says they are ocean people now. I also thought it was strange that the answer to beat the big bad guy was using the hostage method with his son, which feels like hypocrisy.

The lack of emotional investment might be a side effect of visual overstimulation. This happens to me all the time on big screen, reason why I prefer to watch the story on a smaller screen in lower resolution. The story is simple but so is our human story, it is simple, but when we try to fix things we broke we come face to face with the impossible.

I didn't even notice environmentalist message. I cared more for the anti-colonialist message. Jake was in the Navi insurgency but things got too dangerous for his children so he ran away.

I really like that James put a lot of effort into the cinematography this time. It was probably the mocap tech in the first one but that movie looks like a 3 hour video game cutscene. This definitely had more thought to how the shots should represent the story as well as flow together instead of just dollying the camera sideways every 5 seconds.

I can't believe you didn't got why spider sometimes looks like he is bonding or rooting for the avatar From the sky, spider is a pet for the Sully 's even when Jake loves him he always disposable when danger hits, when he knew his father , finally he belonged with someone, even when he is a clone the dad cares for him as his and spider can feel that, I think James Cameron did great with spider's character he is not anoying at all and is easy to see he is profoundly lonely , and to top that , he has to see the girl he loves marrying one of her kind at one point.

Also I think the story feels easy now but with the coming movies it will gain a complex starwars story feel.... I feel by the end the connection between humans and navi would be something biblical... I think eywa is more like an ia or an artificial intelligence stuff maybe humans come from pandora or both are related.... Theres a grand story like interstellar space or space Odyssey somewhere in there and in ground level the connections among the general and sully will also develop hard... By the end it would feel like les miserables toned down a bit with a touch of starwars and with something like what riddley scott wanted to do for alien, with humans and engieneers

Couple of things that bug me. If they could send Quaritch back in Avatar form and backing up his memories and then transfer them to his avatar. Then why Jake was summoned to Pandora in the first place? Wouldn't it be much easier to upload Jake's brother's backup memories to the Avatar be done with it? Some might argue, they don't possess that tech, but then again Quaritch last memory backup was on Pandora meaning it already exists in the first movie... But some might also argue, well they backup the jarheads but not Jake's brother's memories, but then again it doesn't make any sense, a scientist's memory is far more valuable than a jarhead's right? so.... plothole I guess.

as far as how James Cameron ""Cracked the code"" on 3d, i'd say that the Avatar movies are the best at 3D is because of how it portrays depth. 3D isn't useful until it has depth (and a lot of it) to play with. When you get a good amount of depth, you can sense the SCALE of things. Theres this shot i personally thought portrayed depth the most was when you see a character close up, but then you have clouds, then farther back you have an eclipse happening. You can feel the sheer immense scale of the moon behind the character and the massive event thats about to happen.

this film is everything i love about shows. IMMERSION, what's better to get involved in a story than to create a giant world and make superb vfx to support it? During my view, I kept going back to star wars and see how both universes are similar. we got the force in star wars and navi got their gods and beliefs. i recall i heard avatar is going to be a trilogy and I could almost predict what's gonna happen in the next film. Yes, both this and star wars have simple story or morales but sometimes it's just all it needs for a good film.

Spider's motivations throughout the film are very clear. He's 100% on the side of the Na'vi, up until Netiryi damn hear passes a knife through his neck, then he rewards his father for saving his life by returning the favor. In the 3rd movie, many suspect that he will switch sides and help his father, but that remains speculation at this point.

Technically James Cameron has been working on the Avatar series since the early 90s, he had written a scripture for the film series concept. Going on nearly 30yrs now. A lot of people have been finding any reason to hate this latest film, whether it's through meanings like racism or culturally offensive undertones, or being just a bland narrative that doesn't deserve the hype. This film is nothing short of astounding and even the first one holds up incredibly well. So so SO much passion went into the films, and its truly a breath-taking movie.

The stories of Avatar2 are much more complicated than the first one, which really made me exhausted. There are many characters and story lines developing, which brings inevitable distraction; handling too many things simultaneously (fighting against colonialism super power & relation between parents and children & personal matter between Jack and Colonel ) and couldn't resolve all of them with sufficient depth. The ""Commercial whale hunting Pandora version"" brings serious message, very though to watch, very disturbing, and that it is what real world commercial whale hunting looks like. Another upsetting thing is there is literally  limited progress in this movie, many things remained unresolved and wait for the following sequels. For me, Avatar2 is far less enjoyable than the first one, which was much more concise and punchy.

The thing about these movies, is there are so many new elements, ideas, creatures, fauna, biology, and visuals that adding in a complex story is going to be too much. Keeping the story grounded in familiarity allows them to go crazy with everything else without risk of losing the audience. I think we also live in a time where people are too hard to please and are very cynical. The director is like, ‚ÄúLook at this major masterful achievement we made with this movie!‚Äú and people are like, ‚ÄúMeh, looks nice.‚Äù

What I find really odd is the fact that O.G Star Wars is praised by so many, but the story in those films, is also incredibly simple. Big budget movies (Nolan, Reeves and Villeneuve are the big exceptions that comes to mind) are generally better off following simple plots and focusing on atmosphere, character interplay, set pieces and so on. I really like that Chris brings that up because a lot of critics specifically use it to ding the Avatar series but not fellow blockbuster films like Top Gun: Maverick, Mad Max: Fury Road.

I think it was a great sequel probably better than the original especially with the characters (the children). However, My only weird gripe is that it felt like there could just be MORE. Like when you take over 13 years to make a sequel and spend that time touting your brilliance you raise expectations a lot. And when a movie is 3+ hours long there shouldn't be anything left by the wayside or underwhelming. I felt certain storylines went nowhere in 3 hours (the romance between the daughter and one of jake's son), the random female military general who shows up at the beginning and gets totally forgotten about by the end of the film. Why tf was Weaver's character pregnant and by who and how was she able to deliver a baby after she was SHOT and KILLED lol.

Don't be too hard on Spider.

First of all I didn't even felt those 3 hours passing. I was so much into the movie...watched it at 18th of december and I keep thinking about it. I wanna watch it again and again. But what makes me think are my worries...people are so disappointed for some reason, and I'm scared we won't get our avatar 3,4 and 5...the story has just begon people. They just showd us the inside of the planet. Showed new characters. New places. All the new facts. It's just getting started

The word ""bro"" managed to sneak itself thousands of years into the future. They should've just cut out the kids to keep saying ""bro"" all the time. There too many avatar kids involved. Really wanted to see jakes story evolve. Wanted to know more about their ""Eywa"" and hints of origins. The original was just as good...

One of the very few movies worth watching this year.  Since 2020, Hollywood pretty much died.   I remember in 2019 we went to the theatres pretty much every week and some weeks we had to make a choice on what movie we wanted to watch because more than one looked interesting.  This year I think this is the 4th movie I watched.  Very different world.  Also on the premiere night, there was about 80 people in the theatre to watch Avatar 2... same thing happened with Top Gun Maveric, there was like 20 people in the theatre on release night... I don't understand how they can finance these behemoths of movie with no one going to see them !   As for the movie itself, to me it was perfect.  There is not a single bad thing I can say about it.   To me it's a 9/10.  If it was the first movie of the series it would be 10/10.   I had no issues at all with Spider's decisions.   First he was forced to help the humans after being tortured.  Then he decided to save the guy from drowning because he saved his life a few moments before.

The story of rescuing your father from the belly of the whale.  Jake Sully‚Äôs kid does it, and Spider tried to with his ‚Äúdad‚Äù being an asshole (human version) and also an Avatar asshole.  

When spider was with the military avatars and they were on their own, he had fun training.  But he definitely knew right from wrong once they tried to hunt down Jake.

I saw the movie yesterday, and while I was indeed a little ""meh"" about the story, I gotta say it really grew on me with the duration of that movie. I have read some critics going on how visually bland this movie is. And I'm sorry, but it is anything but visually bland. It is a vibrant, beautiful world that feels very natural. I think it is also important to see the story not only movie by movie, but as a whole. And while it wasn't as grand for me personally as the first one, I will not only definitely watch it again in cinema, but I'm also greatly looking forward to the next one, that hopefully will drop.

James Cameron's interview lately said that Kiri will be the main key character in Avatar's saga and as a Huge fan of Sigourney Weaver, nothing more exciting than this news. I knew that James admire her since their first-time movie Aliens that he wanted to recast her back to Avatar 2 and turn her into the main key character for the upcoming series.....can't wait for this.

I just saw this last night.  For the entire evening after viewing this movie I felt emotionally elevated. It was all I could talk about until my spouse and I went to bed. However,  in the morning is when it hit me that the  story line was a little too  'Disney-ish' in theme. Also, the constant cursing really got on my nerves.  It seemed to cheapen the movie in my opinion,  to have the same nemesis from the first film basically rise from the dead all so he could  go after the Scully yet again. But what really had me upset after thinking about it, was that the sequel ended with the open-ended possibility that the same 'evil' guy could come back and   do the chase for yet a 3rd time. Considering the millions of dollars, the sheet amount of time and the number of people who participated in creating such a beautiful film I felt more effort should have put into developing a brand new story line verses  continuing the same old one that frankly most of us have seen many times before in several movies prior to this one.  Anyway, great film I just wish they put more into the plot.

I was very impressed by Avatar 2. At the risk of being hyperbolic: The 3D and the visuals were phenomenal and were close to photoreal, the action was spectacular, and the score was great. I had faith in Cameron as something of a Cameron fanboy since childhood (I'm now 40) and he did not disappoint as usual. I don't normally see movies more than once in the theatre but would have no problem watching it again in 3-D, and recommend seeing it in that format if people have the chance.

I watched it today and really enjoyed the film. From a visual standpoint it's jaw dropping. You'd think that we're used to good CGI in 2022 (and most of us are definitely tired of 3D), but man, this is just on another level. 
The story is simple, yes, but it's also effective. The characters are well flashed-out (yes, except for Spider, I suppose), it's all well acted, the dialog is simple but just feels natural within the world of Pandora. The emotions absolutely worked for me  from the start, and yes, when I watched that intense scene about halfway through I just kept on thinking ""Those humans need to die."" Plus, Na'vi are just damn sexy.

I though Spider as a character made more sense for Cameron to put it there. He symbolizes our current generation who sees through the brutality of our past generation and wanted to protect it but also had some emotional attachment to their past generation and what they have achieved might not have been done if they didn't do it the same way.

I believe that we're not supposed to understand that character's motivation, because he himself does not understand his motivation.  That's the whole point of the character.  If this movie were a standalone that would be quite a problem, but we have more movies coming down the pipe, all with storylines set in stone from before first filming.  This character has a lot of room for development and with any luck at all, he won't get JJ-Abrams'd into a dead end.

i just saw the movie and i wanted to say something about spider. unlike what most people are saying, i do understand his motivations for the most part. At the beginning of the movie theres a scene where spider is playing with the Sully children, and neytiri says to jake that he should ""be with his own kind"". i do wish they expanded upon neytiris opinions on spider a bit more throughout the movie, but i think this scene is fine for the most part. later you can see spider being afraid of neytiri and trying to hide from her during the first scene where the Sullys are escaping the recons, and again during the final battle. furthermore, spider was not raised with a proper father and felt more of an 'outcast', so when he met his 'real father' i cant blame him for being conflicted on who to trust. I think all of those reasons reinforce his indecisiveness on who to side with, along with him caring deeply for his adoptive family and the people who raised him. it's obvious that hes not a perfect character, nor his motivations, but hopefully when the movie comes out on dvd there will be deleted scenes to fill in the blanks.

This movie was great! Just watched it in 3D and holy shit, of course it looks beautiful but it looked AMAZING in 3D. I loved the action that was in the movie, which there is quite a bit more than I had thought there was going to be, and while the middle of the movie did drag a bit while introducing all of the new water stuff, it was much needed as a lot of what was introduced is used in some way shape or form by the end of the film.

the part you mentioned how the character 'spider' is confusing & understand his motives. i believe that's intentionally how Cameron wanted to make it incomplete so that he will reveal it in avatar 3. the way i see it, Avatar 2 is just a build-up for 3. then the ultimate climax will be in Avatar 4 ending the franchise.

I just watched it in IMAX 3D and hgeavily regret that, because the theather for some reason had a very low frame rate, definitely not even close to 60FPS which I expected to be a special feature of this movie. I'd take higher FPS over 3D any time. And btw, Spider's motivation was a very very clear thing actually and his whole story line is very well done, you just didn't get it, it happens. Sometimes you need to watch the movie twice to get all the things in it. He wasn't flipping sides AT ALL, not sure where you got that from. {spoiler} He was hostaged and forced to do certain things, there was no choice at that point.

Spider did feel like a weird character, but he is in quite a complicated situation, wouldn't you say? He gets to be with his father, but loves the Na'Vi. His father isn't actually his father, but clearly shows some form of caring for him. He's just a torn up character.

Everything has been done before and James knows this which is why he focuses more on presentation and less on story with each of his films. I think he's at the stage in his life where he'd like to create more meaningful films and he found that meaning within Avatar. He has earned the right to create something that's all his own while investing all his time into that creation.

I must admit I was hoping James Cameron was going to push the technology further with this movie. I was hoping he would put out at least, a VR experience of Pandora from arriving from space, to forrest to oceans. Or even a way to watch the movie in VR some how that you have almost a 360 view.

So.. Avatar 2. Starting with the soundtrack, Simon Franglen mixed up his creation with James Horner‚Äôs ‚ÄúAvatar 1‚Äù  music elements and pushed to a classical side. It‚Äôs almost like putting on a fully prepared original Italian pizza some extra Cheddar cheese. Combined with some visual moments, where things and live creatures are falling from the sinking ship, it all reminded ‚Äú Titanic‚Äù, which Cameron probably felt nostalgic about and has turned the story to slightly happier ending.

AVATAR always looked awesome in 3D because it was shot from the ground up with stereoscopic cameras, so 3D technology has always been in its core. 

The films that piggybacked on Avatar‚Äôs 3D tech success were shot with regular super 35 or IMAX cameras and a 3D pseudo process was added in post making them look silly and not real 3D at all. It was a gimmick that allowed Hollywood and theatres to charge extra on tickets for ‚Äúthe 3D experience‚Äù when it truly was not.

I just finished the movie with my dad and my brother, and in my opinion, I loved the movie. For me, it does a lot of things that the first movie did but just way better. My biggest problem with the first movie was that it felt too generic. Even the action scenes, I was like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs cool I guess‚Äù. In short, I didn‚Äôt care about anything but I did like enough to see the Avatar 2. And the second movie blew my expectations. I actually gave a sh*t about the characters, the last hour was amazing, I was on the edge of my seat. I loved the family dynamic and the message about family and appreciating the Ocean was done very well, it SHOWED you the message not tell you it. I can see a kid Watching this movie and feeling like to improve on something or appreciate something that they didn‚Äôt before. Now I didn‚Äôt mind the kids doing dumb stuff because it felt realistic to me. Here‚Äôs the thing, kids always do/repeat dumb stuff. I think the reason why Kids repeat the same problem is because they want to prove something and throw experience they learned that they were wrong about it. Really my only problem with the movie was the stuff dealing with Spider‚Äôs character, not bad but felt out of place for me. All in all I just really loved Avatar 2. Im just going to say it right now, I would rather see this movie again than Top Gun: Maverick or The Batman. It has a message that is very relatable and important for younger people and I just cared a lot for the character. It did have its problems but I don‚Äôt care honestly. In my opinion, what matters in a movie is what it does best or what the creator was trying to achieve, not trying to do everything perfectly, i hope that makes sense.

The visuals are as astonishing as you could ever imagine (or not) but personally I would've hoped for more ambiguous moments and complex charakters which probably would have led to a more surprising and deeper storyline

okay my thoughts... I loved the movie, I really liked that there was less of the military than before... in this film there was basically one big ship and one small boat... and I think that was enough... I liked the idea of the general having a blue avatar clone with his memories.. that was okay to me, but what I thought is far fetched that he had a son (spider)... that's like too much for me

I think that a lot of what happens with Spider will become more important in the sequel. I do agree that his characterisation is a bit odd though

I'm totally in. Part of filmmaking is visual art. I agree with the simple story in Avatar. But the technology used to film it! It was BEAUTIFUL to experience it in 3D. That's the only reason I've waiting for Avatar 2 for so many years. Is art in movement at its best. If the story is entertaining to say the minimum it worths the ticket to watch something unique. And see you at the Oscars. I bet on it.

This movie blew me away and is a masterpiece of film making! My only gripe is the frame rate issues in certain scenes which

Spider as a character wasn't executed very well. I understand that spider is wishy washy. But the character is a young teenager who is in a rough situation. He doesn't know what to be. Thankfully his screen presence is limited to being a vehicle for the villain. He doesn't bring the movie down.

Having seen the film myself, I think it's interesting the complaint you had about Spider. I think if you think about it, the exact same complaint could be made about the character Jack (Peter's son) in the movie Hook, which I know you think is an A+ movie. I think what you're missing with Spider is he's just a kid who wasn't really raised by anyone, and as such is somewhat open to easy manipulation.

Simple story is an understatement. I liked the movie, there was a lot of good character building and the visuals are amazing, but after three hours it left me with an empty feeling as the main plotline can be plainly summarized as 'bad guy wants revenge for first movie, but he fails again'

The thing for me about Avatar is that I expect it to be gorgeous and impressive to look at. It's not fair of me to just expect that as a given thing, but that's just how I feel, but I watched Into the Spider-verse a thousand times and it looks gorgeous AND has a great story, a simple one, but told in a spectacular way. Avatar always felt like a tech demo to me, I will watch that movie and I guess I will be blown away by the way it looks, but if the story is as regular as the one of the first movie, I won't love it. That's a shame, Cameron is a great filmmaker and I would love to see him achieve more than just ""yeah it looks amazing""

I've just watched it and for me the weakest aspect of the movie is how the topic of parenting and family is portrayed. I felt like I was watching a movie from the Fifties. Also I had the feeling they rewrote a good chunk of the script mid-way because there are a couple of scenes that don't make much sense. But I went in the theater for a rollercoaster ride, not for a good story, and I wasn't disappointed in the least

1,
2,
3,I can't wait to watch Avatar 4 with my grandchildren
4,"Saw it last night. Aside from what people think of the story and visuals, I felt this was a passion project. Cameron brought his love for science fiction, nature and film making together. I was pleased."
5,"The story was predictable, but the scenes were pure art.  The amount of time put into the visuals and details is mind blowing."
6,"As a son from a military family with a military Dad, the family dynamic is the exact family dynamic I had growing up. The way Sully would get so angry out of love, but not even realize where his anger was coming from was done perfectly. Sully isn't perfect and his dynamic with his family isn't perfect, even though he's trying his best"
7,"I totally see what Chris meant by not being able to get a read on Spider. It was super jarring seeing him chilling and being bros with the enemy, then doing a bunch of switcheroos. His conflicting loyalties needed to be built more organically over the course of the film."
8,Took my wife and kids to this movie and we were absolutely blown away. My six year old couldn‚Äôt believe what he was watching and actually sat through the whole thing.
9,"Just saw the movie and I will say just one thing - This is one of those movies that was made with love, commitment and care, and you can clearly feel it while watching"
10,"I think what they wanted to with Spider was show how he is conflicted. He wants to connect with this new father figure who is the closest he‚Äôll get to the real thing, so he even begrudgingly helps him. But he still loves his adoptive family and the Na‚Äôvi people and helps them when he can. He‚Äôs like Jake Sully, a person who is in-between two planets. It was (relatively) easy for Jake to make the choice between earth and Pandora when he had nobody (It was just Jake and his deceased twin brother), but now Spider sees he could have a future with the humans. I would‚Äôve liked to see more interaction and tempting of Spider, like the humans offering  him a chance to have an avatar and be a medium between the two or as just another soldier. Someone who could conquer the Na‚Äôvi but in a more ‚Äúhumanitarian‚Äù way as he earns their respect and knows their ways. We‚Äôll see how the sequels turns out, I‚Äôm already excited and hope it comes soon."
11,"The length of this movie makes it possible to really get to know all the character and that gives the action a lot of weight. Simple plot, but beautifully put together in all facets of movie-crafting."
12,"Maybe I‚Äôm a sucker, but I emotionally connected the whole time. I felt the subtle facial performances were amazing to watch and sold a lot of the movie for me"
13,It was spectacular. I think I need a second watch because just so much was happening and it was so overwhelming lol. Truly a magnificent sequel
14,This was literally the first time in my life I have ever cried purely off of the visuals alone. It was so beautiful and mind melting. I am 100% going to watch this again!
15,"I think the story in the first Avatar was really simple but the world was so rich and that‚Äôs what made it engaging, seeing how the Na‚Äôvi interact with nature and think about spirituality is what makes that movie impactful. The way James Cameron uses visuals to emphasize the themes in a powerful way is awesome"
16,Avatar 2 was absolutely amazing
17,I was simply blown away with Cameron's work. I loved the way he threw in the TITANIC element at the end wow. A decade of work. Absolutely amazing. VERY AMAZING FAMILY MOVIE where you can go and watch with your children and parents. Total package of a family entertainment. Huge respect for Cameron and his film making. Love Pandora 
18,"I was fascinated by the film. To me the last 45 minutes was a GIANT payoff for the first 2 hours of the movie. It felt like the tension was released, as the Avatar we‚Äôre fighting back against the ‚Äúsky people.‚Äù What an amazing movie. "
19,Well worth the wait. I have no doubt Avatar will do what it needs to do over Christmas weekend and beyond. I saw it today and I've got two more showings booked this week. I'll be booking more showings during and after Christmas as well. I'm positive others will also go out of their way to see and experience this movie in 3D. I got chills watching it. It was such a visceral and emotional experience.
20,"The story was actually really good. It felt like the kind of movie that you find in a dvd set knowing you've got multiple more to watch. I really liked it, it supported the nuclear family."
21,The thing I will always say about Cameron's stories: Simple is not bad.
22,"I‚Äôm glad to see this review has OVER 800K views in four days‚Ä¶clearly the interest for this film is high, and it is a mind-knowingly well done film. Seen it once for the early showing on Thursday, going to see it again tonight. "
23,The scene with kiri being guided by the little glowing animals was a real treat in 3d. Thank you Cameron and the amazing people who brought this movie to life.
24,"Apparently Cameron admitted in an interview that he kept plot simple so a huge audience can enjoy the visual spectacle without being too distracted by intricate story-writing. 

So if this movie satisfies him with it's market performance, he might be focussing on more creative plot line, though I believe the scripts for the sequels are already written."
25,I cried 3 mins in the movie purely bc of the visuals.  And I never thought I would see this movie come to light either. I was so happy 
26,"One thing you should notice watching this absolute masterpiece of a movie is how Cameron uses depth. Its a 3 hour movie. And it seems almost EVERY scene is layered. So many layers. Characters, doodads, plants, animals....layer upon layer to create depth EVERYWHERE....its absolutely amazing to look at. The effects themselves are out of this world, but the sheer amount of work that must have gone into filming this and planning the shots, I have simply no idea how this movie is humanly possible. Once you start noticing the depth, its impossible not to. Its EVERYWHERE. And it is absolutely fantastic."
27,I'm glad to hear this movie is actually worth a watch
28,"This was breathtaking,  Cameron never makes a bad movie,  it's as simple as that."
29,I just love how these movies have this dramatic nature documentary vibe to them.
30,The best way I can describe this movie is it's a whole lot like a very intricately designed and state of the art roller coaster ride. It doesn't really break ground in terms of plot but the execution is in a whole new level of artistry and technical prowess.
31,"I just came back from seeing this a second time with my parents and my opinion hasn‚Äôt changed too much, but this was one of the best experiences seeing a movie in theaters a second time. "
32,If you have kids especially sons you will feel very emotionally connected to this movie. I legit cried lol.
33,I think simple plot/technical achievement is the formula to almost all of Cameron‚Äôs movies not just Avatar.
34,What I got from the Spider character was that he didn‚Äôt know who he was supposed to be. He wasn‚Äôt fully accepted by the Naveen and when he was taken and tortured there were no attempts to rescue him.  Sully fled with his family and the Naveen went on with their lives as usual. At least the Colonel threw him some sort of lifeline and showed some love and compassion.
35,I wished they would‚Äôve showed more of Neytiri in the film. More interactions with her and Jake like in the first film.
36,"I actually think the avatar story is underrated, and I like how they gave time for the characters to have their own personalities and the slice of life kind of stuff."
37,"This is definitely a film you need to watch a few times. It's just so dense. And of course visually breathtaking. I wasn't blown away by the story or dialogue, but it's easy to forgive when you see this magic on screen. And it is magic. It made me feel like being a 5 year old again and seeing the batmobile for the first time. Or 2 years later seeing a metal man, a helicopter fly through a bridge, Arnie surfing a crashing tanker truck...even the first Avatar didn't bring me back to that child like feeling."
38,I watched this movie at an IMAX Screen. It was THE most spectacular cinematic experience I have had in my whole life. I was in tears throughout. I could not believe what I was seeing. Watch it at an IMAX if you can!
39,"You hit the nail on the head with how they make these movies more agreeable for the general audience. Just look at how he did Titanic. At its base, it's a simple Romeo and Juliet story more or less with an action movie going on in the background."
40,"I've seen this with my big sister in IMAX 3D. I didn't realize how the frame rates were when we started watching the movie, especially in 3D. We get to know more about the characters, and there's a Na'vi sign language we know. The creators of Avatar, and Cameron, always does a good job with the graphics, visuals, stories, and character designs. I look forward to watching it on Disney+ soon!"
41,I really enjoyed all of the little b and c plots. And visually this movie was insane. It was such an experience. I wanna go back and see it in 3D
42,"Just saw it today and I gotta say, I thought it was absolutely mind blowing! I agree on Spider in every way. He was odd but even with that the movie was beyond great. I can‚Äôt think of the last time we got 2 films in the same year as good as Avatar & TG Maverick.  We needed this after the pandemic closed all the theaters."
43,You know people are curious about the movie when it‚Äôs his most watched review in ages! Loved the movie. Looking forward to watching it again in the same format (IMAX and 3D)
44,I watched it 1 week ago and I can tell you I felt I was only for 1 hour or so. It keeps you amazed by the beautiful environment and visuals.  This is his magnum opus and a work of love
45,"I totally understand Spider's motivation and internal conflict. I think how he feels is similar to how Kitty feels; that yearning, curiosity and grief. The difference is that there's also anger in him whereas Kitty's is all love. He flips back and forth because there's this test of loyalty between his biology vs what truly encompasses family. The conflict is more evident towards the end but I felt his conflict and grief throughout the entire movie. I think his character will only develop more as the series continues...at least I hope anyway. "
46,"I think Spider was a pretty clear character
He's grown up with the Na'vi and the few remaining Humans who sided with them in the original movie
He's taken by the recoms to the new settlement where he bonds a little bit with quaritch enough to at least not want him to die by the end, even if he was disgusted with what he was doing"
47,"While the story is simple in both movies, I did enjoy the second one a lot more. Visually, this is one of the most beautiful movies will see for years to come, and the pacing is much better than the first one I feel. Really curious to see how the storyline will continue over the next parts"
48,"This movie was an emotional experience and I left the theater thinking ""we as a human species, needs to be better"". 
It was without a doubt worth the wait and I can't wait for 3,4,5."
49,"Honestly, I loved it. Most shows nowadays focus on grey morality and preaching. To see a movie that its good vs bad, and especially for a younger audience to have something to aspire to, rather than become cynical is great."
50,"There was a little girl with her family sitting almost directly in front of me in the theater, about 5 or 6, and she was crying with some scenes featuring the ocean wildlife in this movie. This is the sort of experience I like about these movies so much. They're made with so much care, they seem so real yet fantastical, I can imagine how little kids will grow up and relish the memories of watching this in theaters, and maybe even fall in love with film, by watching movies like Avatar The Way of Water. I freaking loved this movie."
51,"I think part of the reason why Cameron is keeping these movies' themes and plot so simple it‚Äôs because he is thinking about a global audience, so universal themes like family will resonate, people can shit on him all they want but if they were managing a movie at this scale they probably do the same."
52,"I never got bored of the humans in Avatar 1. It would be even better with the deleted scenes (obviously). I loved the boss, even if he is considered a cliche, but is given more life in deleted scenes, I loved the colonel, that's why I'm happy they didn't kill him off in this new one. The whole son father dynamic between him and Spyder is a great addition. I was actually cheering on the him on in his fight with Sully. I wasn't sure if James would kill him off like in the first film. Either way, great movie."
53,"Describing those viewing experience in words is almost impossible.. What a lovely evening it was for me. A complete Divine Experience. Ô∏èÔ∏è

Hats off Cameron!!You nailed it. Thank you for Delivering a visual Treat to us.. "
54,I saw this movie in 4DX and it was one of the greatest cinematic experiences I've ever had.
55,"I was very amazed by the amound of detail it was put in. No spot was missed. While watching it, a thought accured on my mind saying ""there has to be lots of copy and pasting in this"" lmao. Though ofc, it has more detail than that and I loved it! The father and son dynamic really hit me, the villain side I could kinda feel it but we'll see what the third movie has in store with that progression"
56,Love the overarching theme of colonial critique. Very interested to see how far they will lean into that going forward. Could give this series so much more depth.
57,This is definitely top 5 most gorgeous movies ever made. I didn‚Äôt even see it on a top tier screen and it looked spectacular. I also really liked the children in this movie and want to know what else will happen to them
58,"I loved Spiders character. As stated he was a stray dog. Calling home a place that can kill him within minutes just by breathing. He is the weakest within his chosen people. He is dragged by fate and left by few choices.
I also really loved the troubled father-son dinamics. Quaritch is one of my favorite character. He is not purely a warmongering maniac, but troubled by his past life memories."
59,"i watched Avatar II in 3D and i love it.  story was simple and straight forward, Visuals is Amazing. made me wanna know about the different tribes, their way of life"
60,"I was crying throughout the movie , breathtaking , my tears were uncontrollable ."
61,"Just went and saw it , omg I was so emotional through the whole movie ,  i didnt notice the length of it at all. Very impressed how JC gets you to be involved with the characters , and makes me hate my own race. Beautiful Movie"
62,"My friend thought the ""graphics weren't even that good""  I was blown away. I thought there we're too many plot/character contrivances in the story, but visually it's a complete masterwork "
63,Watched it a few hours ago. It was so captivating that I didn't realize 3 hours had passed when the movie ended. Props to James Cameron and his team...
64,This was a amazing experience and the story totally pulled me in.  Loved it and want more of this franchise.  Im in.
65,"I think spyder‚Äôs motive is left ambiguous throughout the film because of the sequel. I think a lot more questions will be answered in the sequel, but also believe that he could act as a possible bridge between the Na‚Äôvi and the sky people, especially quaritch. I hypothesise that Spyder will be able to complete what Jake was unable to do in the first film and create unity between humans and na‚Äôvi in Pandora. Or if that is not the case, a complete side switch to the sky people and will end up being a battle between the two protagonist and antagonist‚Äôs sons, almost as like a ‚Äúwho can carry the legacy and remain on top‚Äù"
66,"Seen it in 2D and 3D and I agree, it is just enough 3D to make it enjoyable without it becoming too much. I was impressed by how much was left as 2D and only certain parts of each shoot were brought into 3D. Excellent."
67,"I'm actually excited for the next movie, I actually wish that the movie was longer"
68,I think that when they were scanning Spider‚Äôs brain they were also putting subtle sleeper agent stuff into his mind too. I think he was reprogrammed to protect his ‚Äúfather‚Äù and that‚Äôs why he pulled him out of the water. Maybe they also put something in him that would trigger and make him kill Jake while he has his guard down one day.
69,I think the 4 hour cut that‚Äôll inevitably be released will help us feel more attached to the characters
70,Absolutely incredible film. Tbh I cried my eyes out at the end.
71,"I saw spider's flip flopping as a product of him still being a kid and being torn between helping his (spoiler) father and his adopted family. He also wanted to save his own skin, so his actions reflected that - maybe it could stem from his always being somewhat left out leading to a desire to fit in wherever he finds himself."
72,"Regarding Spider: I really liked how wishy-washy the character is. He is a kid who was raised in a family where he doesn‚Äôt fit in. His biological dad was demonized by his community for as long as he has known and he bought into that. He meets that father who disowns him at first. Throughout the movie he is torn between his community and family that raised him and the biological connection he has to his father. Of course he is going to make illogical and inconsistent decisions. The boy doesn‚Äôt yet know who he is. The whole plot of the movie, from his perspective, is an identity crisis."
73,"You were right on every point. I saw it in IMAX 3D with HFR (high frame rate). And it was a truly awesome experience. I will see it a second time - but this time I want to try the Screen X version. No, the movie isn't perfect, but not once was I left gasping at any waste of money - cause it's all visible. Yes, the story is easy to follow in that the good is all good, and the villains are truly hissable. Yes, it takes a little time to establish things, but hell, I'm encouraging people to see it."
74,This was a visually and technically fantastic and highly entertaining film from start to finish. It wasn't perfect story-wise but really what more can you ask for from a blockbuster film!?!
75,"I was amazed how Cameron managed to make me invested in the fates of 7 main characters. I absolutely adored this movie, it's an old-fashioned, well-made blockbuster. Three hours flew by like 90 minutes."
76,"Just saw this movie in IMAX 3D
And WOOOWWW !!! Just... Im lost for words for the visual !!

I am not a 3D movie person.. in fact i got dizzy when i watched 3D converted movies, but this one.. this one is THE BEST! "
77,"I watched it the other night and I was pleasantly surprised to be honest. I didn't think it was going to be good at all. Good story, I was engaged from start to finish and it's a long movie but you really don't notice it until it's over. Looking forward to Avatar 3!"
78,"Saw this over the holiday with dad.  It has some problems mostly with pacing in the first half and in the general theme of the movie.  I mean, absolutely do save the whales, save all of them, but it's basically the same story over again with a different cast of characters and marginally different character dynamics.  "
79,"I watched it and loved it. Even over time I feel myself drawn to that world. I am still floored by Sigourney Weaver's performance as Kiri. I still don't believe that was her. However, if it hadn't been shot in IMAX I wouldn't have bothered seeing it in the theater. It takes me a lot these days to go to the theater. I have 4K HD at home and there are a lot of movies that look better at home than they do at the movies. Avatar isn't one of them. It has to be seen in the theater, in IMAX. It's the same with Top Gun: Maverick. As soon as they announced that it was shot in IMAX I knew I had to see in the theater. Did Avatar have to be 3D? Maybe. I am not bothered by 3D especially when it's done right. Avatar is definitely an IP that knows how to use 3D."
80,I felt the same way about Spider's relationships and motivation though now in retrospect I think that blurry line and confusion was very intentional. I want to see how that unfolds in Avatar 3.
81,I know for me the main draw of these films is the speculative biology aspect of it. Not a lot of films or directors go to the lengths to create such a large world with so much thought put into it. Liked Jackson's King Kong remake a lot for the same reason.
82,"Went to the cinema with friends after a long week of work thinking I would have doozed off halfway through it while watching it.
Took me by surprise, for real. I loved the World building and the design of everything.
Such a stunning experience. Storywise yeah, it was pretty simple, but that clearly isnt the focus of the Film."
83,"I just left this film. I LOVED the first. Absolutely LOVE the second as well takes me back and I love it. Cried a bunch even at moments I didn‚Äôt think I would, amazing."
84,Saw it last night in IMAX 3D and it was a god damn masterpiece. Will see a second or maybe a third time.
85,Saw it on IMAX. It was incredibly visually stunning! It felt like you were really in the ocean Ô∏è
86,"Jake actually perfectly explained in the beginning of the movie what Spider felt and is like as a character, if you were all listening.. Pretty funny though if you think of him that way in the whole movie."
87,The first movie came out literally half my life ago. I was 13 and now I‚Äôm 26. I‚Äôm excited !
88,"Even tho the ending was not how I expected it, the details and graphics of the film was amazing. Watched it in 3d and props for the amazing work and detail."
89,"Simple stories aren't a bad thing. Too many movies these days have these bloated casts with little to nothing for many of the characters to do, there are too many subplots that do go anywhere, and plot and character development take a backseat to explosions and CGI. Keeping things focused means you can really invest in the characters and make sure the plot is fleshed out."
90,"I enjoyed it more than I thought. It was visually stunning, and a great escape this weekend. I'm into movies like these, I think it deserves a watch. Saw it on Dolby Cinema 3D. Best way to see it. The 3D was really well done."
91,"I liked it way more than I thought it would. I‚Äôve started to tealize exactly what Chris said - it‚Äôs a simple story painted across a broad canvas. That‚Äôs the perfect way to describe it, and it makes me appreciate the films a lot more. If you go in expecting a complex story, you‚Äôll be disappointed. But once I understood that, I enjoyed the experience so much more."
92,"I wasn't as enamored with the first Avatar as everyone else, but I felt Way of Water was a much better film. Mileage will certainly vary, but I really enjoyed WoW's dedication to character development and making its really simple story work. I wasn't annoyed by the teen characters in the ways I would've been annoyed by them in other films and that was huge for me."
93,It's nice hearing Chris talk about movies after having become a filmmaker himself. His feedback feels more mature and insightful than before.
94,"Despite my best efforts, I was emotionally moved.

It also passed the pee test: It's a film worth the holding, at least once."
95,"Fantastic review, I agree with almost everything you said. I'm regards to the first hour, I was so happy that Cameron let the movie breath and took its time showing the viewer the daily lives of the new clan. It felt like that section shouldve dragged, but I was just in awe of the visuals on the whole time. It was just so calm and peaceful and really helped to flesh out the world by showing the culturual and evolutionary differences between the different Navi. It woukdve been simpler to make this section more montagey,  but I found it so effective that they slowed the film down and immersed the viewer in this new world."
96,"Hey Chris, big fan of the channel been watching your vids for years.  By far my favorite movie reviewer out there.  While I do agree there is a message about saving the forest in Avatar 1, and saving the oceans in Avatar 2, I do think its goes much DEEPER than that.  Eywa is a large part of the meaning, it's the spiritual bond we have with nature and the earth itself.  Caring for the environment, ya sure, but realizing you are a living breathing part of the environment, we are all part of the one.  Kiri was a great example because she was suppose to be un-pure, but she showed to have one of the strongest connections with Eywa, it doesn't matter what you are it matters who you are and who you choose to be.  James is trying to get us to remember who we are."
97,Its a good movie... The visuals are what that gives you goosebumps... Ill definitely watch it again...
98,I love super long movies like The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. Avatar is pure eye candy
99,"The message of Avatar

First movie: protect the forest.
Second movie: protect the ocean"
100,Sad millions have passed away due to the Pandemic and could not see this masterpiece. Let's all be grateful.
101,"While I look forward to seeing this film, I'm sad, as it may be that Mr. Cameron may have packed his bags and moved to Pandora... and these films will be his legacy and all we get from him henceforth.  Thanks for the review."
102,"Much better then I expected I had no intentions on watching but very happy I did , I cried my eyeballs out beautifully movie , loved the story  line I feel like spider is going to be an issue in later films"
103,"So funny - my reaction was the opposite.  The first half blew me away, I could have sat in a theater and watched it for hours.  Second half - Oh, they're fighting now.  I completely checked out.  It actually felt like I was watching the second half of Titanic.   I would totally pay to go see it in a really good 3D theater - but I would leave once the fighting starts and feel satisfied with the money spent."
104,The film had a lot of feeling to it and a lot strength to its emotional aspects I really appreciated that.
105,"You know, my favorite thing about the movie is, like, it feels like a movie. It feels like a real, like, you know, 'go to the theater' film movie."
106,"I really enjoyed the movie. A visual feast indeed. I was thorougly entertained. However I did find the ocean scenery after a bit grew a little tedious and well, a bit boring. It was very cool at first, seeing underwater, etc, but after awhile, I wanted them to go back to the forrest that had so many cool things in it landscape wise, trees, giant trees, moutains, so many creatures. Or at least travel on to explore more of Pandora. I hope in the next one, its not ALL on the same Island. But still a great movie overall for me. YetI can totally see peoples issues with it 100%. But for me, it didnt kill the movie experience/"
107,I first saw it in IMAX 3D at 24 fps and it looked really good seeing it at a larger format and the 3D was just constantly popping throughout the movie without making it in your face. And I also watched it a second time in RealD 3D at 48 fps which really open my eyes to me it helped the 3D feel more accessible it felt very smooth and made the action sequences and visuals look eye candy it's pretty surreal watching a movie with such high frame rate since I'm used to watching movies and TV shows at 24 fps but 48 fps just blew my mind. It may seem like old news for anyone who watched a movie at a higher frame rate like The Hobbit Trilogy or Gemini Man and that people are mixed by it but for my first time experiencing it felt like a game changer.
108,"I think with Spider there was a little bit of ""doesn't matter if your dad is a killer he's still your dad"" going on.  So Spider was conflicted and even he didn't know which side he should pick."
109,"If you liked the first one, you‚Äôll like this one. It did the job in reviving the interest with the Avatar universe."
110,"I watched this as soon as it was released , I couldn‚Äôt wait. I personally thought it was stunning. Not once was I aware that I had been sat there for 3 hours . Amazing . "
111,"i just watched avatar 2 a few hours ago, one of the best movies i've seen in 2022. it was definitely so so worth watching. it also felt so special since i watched the first movie when i was 5 and now im 18 :"")"
112,"I went to see it yesterday, December the 27th with my two kids, we love the first one,  my one daughter was too young to see the first one when it came out but I thought James Cameron was not going to be able to come anywhere near close the first one, I wouldn't say it's better than the first one but I would say out of 10,  I would give it at least a 9-9 1/2. I thoroughly enjoyed it I definitely would watch it again. I saw it in 3D, I might go and see it again on IMAX but, I highly would recommend it. Best film I've seen all year.. and because everybody was blue I thought it would have had difficulty identifying the bad guy, but it wasn't difficult identifying the bad people at all. And to have a villain that brilliant, if anyone wants to make a movie and they want to have a villain it doesn't get any better than the villain in this film. And the people who are not very nice you have a sense of Joy when they comeuppance happens. I think James Cameron will top three billion dollars with this simply because to watch it on 3D costs a little bit more to watch on this format and I'll be surprised if anyone really wants to watch it on 2D but be prepared to be yet again visually Blown Away and emotionally Blown Away"
113,"Amazing film. Definitely going to see it again. I went in skeptical. Instead was blown away. Even more beautiful than the first film. You're constantly asking ""how?"" As to the story, it's not much more complex than the first film's, though there are more characters and themes about family in it. But you know what, that's all you need for something like this. Strong recommend."
114,"I love your movie reviews, Chris. Please continue doing this even after you become an established director. You are an invaluable & genuine critic and I, like many others, immensely enjoy your opinions on this art form."
115,I felt he handled the 3D well. Some scenes had little 3D while other were really  3D.
116,"Watched it last night and loved the film it was really long and I was tired but it was worth it in the end, I‚Äôll definitely be watching it again!"
117,"My biggest worry about Cameron wanting to do 3 more sequels after this one is what are they going to be about?  Humans vs Navi?  We had that in the last film, and most likely we'll see that again in this film.  I hope he returns to making original movies again."
118,"Yes, there's indeed a 2D option for this movie in theaters. That's actually the option I chose when I bought my  for this one. In 2009 tho i watched the 1st one in 3D but didn't really enjoyed that much that way."
119,"Chis Stuckmann generally gives me very good indications whether I should go see a movie or not. Last night I saw The Outfit and I really enjoyed it. But with Avatar, I was very underwhelmed in contrast to its hype at the time and like you said, I had to painstakenly endure the 3D hype that ensued. And I really like JC's work, T2 Judgement Day is my favorite movie of all time and I acknowledge his pioneering view. "
120,It was far better than I expected and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
121,"I saw it in Dolby Vision and it was incredible! I saw the first one in 3D which was the best cinema experience I've ever had but Avatar 2 still translates visually in 2D, with the Dolby Vision anyway."
122,"This film is utterly astonishing.  The visuals are way beyond what the original achieved.  The action sequences are masterfully constructed--to such a degree of precision that is simply mind-boggling.  And you know,--the story and dialogue are just fine.  It does what it needs to do, and so much more.  I guess my only gripe is that once Jake--as the war chief--is essentially hunted into exile, he's no longer a real threat to human interests.  The human forces could have just let up at that point and proceeded directly to exploiting the planet.  But the scope we're given into the value of Pandora and why humans are truly there, really flesh out just how precious ""The Balance"" is on Pandora.  It's the true stuff of dreams: biological access to our ancestors in a mediated afterlife through a free, planetary network.  A religion with true merit.  I for one can't remember the last time I saw a movie this enthralling.  I absolutely loved the methodical pace of the first act.  The film is genuinely touching and authentic in a way none of his other stories are."
123,Literally came back from the theatre a couple minutes ago. Mind blown and already making plans to see it again soon!
124,"I watched and enjoyed as well.  Admittedly, it took like 45 minutes to really get into it.  But everything was tied together nicely.  I remember initially not being excited to see this bc of all the time that pasted b/w the two movies.  But this ended up being worth my Saturday afternoon."
125,I watched this in 3D on theater and boy oh boy was this an experience.. damn good
126,"I admire your honest, positive review. So many hater reviews (for the sake of being contrarian) out there. Your review is refreshingly accurate and not overly critical for the sake of sensationalism."
127,Loved it! Was excited for the whole 3 hrs . Visually it‚Äôs unbelievable
128,"I never questioned Spider‚Äôs motivations. He was left with few options. At every opportunity he chose the Na‚Äôvi. In the end he makes a decision that comes out of compassion. He‚Äôs along for a ride that he‚Äôs not in control of but I never felt conflicted about his motivations. Where we go for here, not sure but his arc was clear to me."
129,"Congrats on 2 million, Chris! What an incredible journey"
130,"I thought Spider's motivations were clear. He is a Na'vi, loves his adopted family and his home in Pandora. His ""helping"" of the bad guys is essentially forced in the first case and indirect in the second (I think just showing that he's kind and compassionate, unlike his biological father)."
131,I like the fact that spider was somewhat unpredictable. It the film more intersting. I will say i would have rather seen Quatrich survive on his own verses spider helping him. Especially considering how tough he is supposed to be.
132,I loved it. Great 3D  super thrilling and emotional. Awesome review. Everyone e is always trying to be so clever. I was just in awe
133,"I had a lot of problems with the story. I felt like the message at the end was strange as basically ""use violence to protect your family"". I thought the big action scene at the end went on too long, and I was kinda disturbed that the Navi were murdering all of these average Joe's on the ship. Kitty has a moment where she crushes a submarine and as the guy is swimming up to the surface to breathe she grabs him and presumably drowns him. I didn't like that the film felt like time wasted until Jake finally decided to stay and fight. It made me laugh when at the end he says they are ocean people now. I also thought it was strange that the answer to beat the big bad guy was using the hostage method with his son, which feels like hypocrisy."
134,"the fact that people, including me and my wife, were crying over sea creatures that didnt actually exist is a proof how marvelous this movie is."
135,The original Avatar came out during one of the toughest times of my life. I needed an injection of strength and hope. The 3D visuals were the best I‚Äôd ever seen and the story gave me that shot of hope and optimism I needed.
136,"The best big movie I have ever seen since the first Star Wars. Yes same old story of invaders vs. rebels that we have seen over and over again. But it's about family values, amazing character development, Incredible visuals and time taken to show them just hanging out. Excellent in 3D. Much better that the first."
137,"The lack of emotional investment might be a side effect of visual overstimulation. This happens to me all the time on big screen, reason why I prefer to watch the story on a smaller screen in lower resolution. The story is simple but so is our human story, it is simple, but when we try to fix things we broke we come face to face with the impossible."
138,"SPOILER:
*
*
*"
139,Spot on review. Definitely a little shocked that they spent so long working on it and an entire fish army seems to vanish in one big plot hole in the climax.
140,"I don't think a story being simple immediately means it's bad (and I don't think Chris said it in a negative way either). Sometimes the best stories are quite simple, it all depends on the execution."
141,"I didn't even notice environmentalist message. I cared more for the anti-colonialist message. Jake was in the Navi insurgency but things got too dangerous for his children so he ran away. At the end of the movie, he realized that the humans were going to take over more and more of Pandora so he decided he would stop running and fight"
142,"I had very high expectations for Avatar 2, and my expectations were exceeded"
143,I loved this movie. I saw it last night on an IMAX screen and in 3D‚Ä¶ it was well worth the $18! The visuals were amazing! Wow.
144,"I think Spider‚Äôs role represents most of us. When we see what‚Äôs bad, we witness a lot of what‚Äôs wrong but we don‚Äôt do much to change it. We‚Äôre in a big grey zone.  Like we can‚Äôt give up oil & gas next week but we‚Äôre trying to be environmentally aware in other ways (recycling, composting, no more plastic bags‚Ä¶)"
145,I really like that James put a lot of effort into the cinematography this time. It was probably the mocap tech in the first one but that movie looks like a 3 hour video game cutscene. This definitely had more thought to how the shots should represent the story as well as flow together instead of just dollying the camera sideways every 5 seconds.
146,Thanks for the review. I'm glad Avatar 3 has already been filmed and part of 4 as well. Which is a big reason for the delay. So Cameron will knock out the sequels a lot faster. He was also waiting for the technology to be able to motion capture underwater properly.
147,I 10000% agree with you. I cried like 5 times from admiring the beauty of planet Pandora ü•π. Our world could be similar if it wasn‚Äôt for us sky people . If I had the opportunity to become a water Avatar I would 123456789% take it.
148,"I can't believe you didn't got why spider sometimes looks like he is bonding or rooting for the avatar From the sky, spider is a pet for the Sully 's even when Jake loves him he always disposable when danger hits, when he knew his father , finally he belonged with someone, even when he is a clone the dad cares for him as his and spider can feel that, I think James Cameron did great with spider's character he is not anoying at all and is easy to see he is profoundly lonely , and to top that , he has to see the girl he loves marrying one of her kind at one point."
149,"I totally agree with your assessment of Spider. His loyalties were all over the place. There was potential for it to be more impactful, but I think they just gave up on the writing of his character."
150,"Also I think the story feels easy now but with the coming movies it will gain a complex starwars story feel.... I feel by the end the connection between humans and navi would be something biblical... I think eywa is more like an ia or an artificial intelligence stuff maybe humans come from pandora or both are related.... Theres a grand story like interstellar space or space Odyssey somewhere in there and in ground level the connections among the general and sully will also develop hard... By the end it would feel like les miserables toned down a bit with a touch of starwars and with something like what riddley scott wanted to do for alien, with humans and engieneers"
151,"This cinematic experience was unmatched for me. 

IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED THE MOVIE YET JUST SKIP THIS COMMENT AND COME BACK LATER!"
152,This one left me speechless for a bit...Not sure if cinema could get any better than thisÔ∏è
153,"Great movie  Ground breaking effects once again, under water masterpiece"
154,"Couple of things that bug me. If they could send Quaritch back in Avatar form and backing up his memories and then transfer them to his avatar. Then why Jake was summoned to Pandora in the first place? Wouldn't it be much easier to upload Jake's brother's backup memories to the Avatar be done with it? Some might argue, they don't possess that tech, but then again Quaritch last memory backup was on Pandora meaning it already exists in the first movie... But some might also argue, well they backup the jarheads but not Jake's brother's memories, but then again it doesn't make any sense, a scientist's memory is far more valuable than a jarhead's right? so.... plothole I guess."
155,I'm excited for 3 and 4 to come out and then having a marathon with the family Ô∏è
156,This was visual trick a treat for the eyes and I love all the candy they were serving
157,You can't beat a well made 3d movie for immersion. I'm excited to see Jim re-educate Hollywood on how to do it properly.
158,"I just watched Avatar the way of water and the imagination that went into expanding the world of Pandora and creating the creatures and scenery is awesome.
Thoroughly enjoyed the movie ."
159,I loved this movie it was so good the themes of family and watching the characters grow was really good
160,"as far as how James Cameron ""Cracked the code"" on 3d, i'd say that the Avatar movies are the best at 3D is because of how it portrays depth. 3D isn't useful until it has depth (and a lot of it) to play with. When you get a good amount of depth, you can sense the SCALE of things. Theres this shot i personally thought portrayed depth the most was when you see a character close up, but then you have clouds, then farther back you have an eclipse happening. You can feel the sheer immense scale of the moon behind the character and the massive event thats about to happen. "
161,James Cameron did a special about ‚ÄúLeaving Titanic‚Äù. He was invested in that project and now is invested in Avatar. I hope he can continue in this obsession to the end. George Lucas couldn‚Äôt do Star Wars the way he wanted and I‚Äôd like to see Avatar finish correctly.
162,I loved it but the end absolutely broke my heart
163,Saw it in 3D today. Was assuming it was going to be a rehash of the first but this one is like an Aliens/T2/Avatar/Titanic hybrid that has to be seen to be believed. He pushes the visual envelope once again. Amazing. Definitely going back.
164,"this film is everything i love about shows. IMMERSION, what's better to get involved in a story than to create a giant world and make superb vfx to support it? During my view, I kept going back to star wars and see how both universes are similar. we got the force in star wars and navi got their gods and beliefs. i recall i heard avatar is going to be a trilogy and I could almost predict what's gonna happen in the next film. Yes, both this and star wars have simple story or morales but sometimes it's just all it needs for a good film."
165,"Just saw it this afternoon.  Can confirm there's 2D showings,  the theater I went to didn't even have a 3D option.  Wasn't a fan of the story,  but the visuals had me sold."
166,I was blown away! Movie was fantastic!
167,"I cried almost 50% of the film.
The music gets me every time "
168,"Spider's motivations throughout the film are very clear. He's 100% on the side of the Na'vi, up until Netiryi damn hear passes a knife through his neck, then he rewards his father for saving his life by returning the favor. In the 3rd movie, many suspect that he will switch sides and help his father, but that remains speculation at this point."
169,"I actually just got back from a showing of this movie in 2D before watching your video. I can say that even not in 3D I found the visuals to be utterly spectacular. Well worth the wait from the first movie, and I now eagerly anticipate the sequel!"
170,I waited a fair few years for this but I could clearly see the difference in the technical realms.  The story line overall was way too long (Like Avengers End Game) and there I was thinking this would be the last Avatar but No!  Please don't mess the final movie up like The Matrix Resurrections did.  I am still in therapy!  Great Review Chris 
171,"I think the young human character's story arc is meant to be a conflict between his Na'vi 'family', and the unexpected reappearance of his father, albeit it in an alien form."
172,"Hey Chris, would you ever consider bringing back the underrated/overlooked series? I think it really helped introduce me (and probably other people) to great movies I never would've seen without your videos."
173,This is the best sequel movie ever and one of the best movies Ive seen in a long time. My first time actually crying in a movie and I‚Äôve never done that so definitely worth watching
174,"I saw someone say one of the complaints about the movie is that sometimes the film focuses too much on the visuals and nature and sort of neglects the storyline that he felt like he was watching Animal Planet, but honestly I have no problems with it "
175,"This is the best cinematic experience I have had in years. I was really skeptical about a second Avatar movie, but man did it deliver! Can‚Äôt wait for the third movie."
176,I really enjoyed the use of high frame rate in action scenes. When viewing in 3D pan shots and fast action are really blurred and disorienting
177,"Seen it twice so far, IMAX 3D first time. Normally the second. Absolutely loved it both times it's amazing."
178,I loved it. Bring on Avatar 3!
179,"Technically James Cameron has been working on the Avatar series since the early 90s, he had written a scripture for the film series concept. Going on nearly 30yrs now. A lot of people have been finding any reason to hate this latest film, whether it's through meanings like racism or culturally offensive undertones, or being just a bland narrative that doesn't deserve the hype. This film is nothing short of astounding and even the first one holds up incredibly well. So so SO much passion went into the films, and its truly a breath-taking movie."
180,I loved this movie! And I think that this movie is a lot like Maverick. Strong fathers and family being at the forefront.
181,"Personally, I don't think simple is bad. A simple story that's beautiful and engaging to the common audience member is gonna stick with a lot of people. Even if it's done before.
So you bring something new and likeable to an old story, and do it correctly, then you are doing something right in my eyes."
182,"Finally a fantastic movie, it's been awhile , had a little of everything , drama , action, comedy, thrilling, it's not a movie for people who have bad ADHD n who over analyze a movie or expects a perfect movie, 10/10"
183,"This movie is a masterpiece‚Ä¶ and while the storyline is acceptably simple, to deny the magnitude of the graphics and even the emotional involvement, is to simply be a devils advocate. This film is a 12/10"
184,"I saw it today, worth every dime. I want to see it again, Cameron is a genuis!"
185,"The stories of Avatar2 are much more complicated than the first one, which really made me exhausted. There are many characters and story lines developing, which brings inevitable distraction; handling too many things simultaneously (fighting against colonialism super power & relation between parents and children & personal matter between Jack and Colonel ) and couldn't resolve all of them with sufficient depth. The ""Commercial whale hunting Pandora version"" brings serious message, very though to watch, very disturbing, and that it is what real world commercial whale hunting looks like. Another upsetting thing is there is literally  limited progress in this movie, many things remained unresolved and wait for the following sequels. For me, Avatar2 is far less enjoyable than the first one, which was much more concise and punchy."
186,"Saw it yesterday. I really liked it, great spoiler free review. Its just a good movie and we dont get those much anymore. Lucky to get 2 this year top gun and this."
187,"This movie was made for Chris to review. Chris has become a very technical reviewer (not that that‚Äôs a bad thing), and this movie‚Äôs strength is in its technical achievements"
188,Spider will probably be the bridge between the humans and Navi. Since the Sully's are half human they can mate and the grandchild might allow for his father and the human to stop their conquest. Also the fact that spider learned about the potential of immortality ect.
189,"def resonate with this sentiment, i expected to be blown away after the reviews but i can't remember the last time i even sat thru a 2 hour movie without being distracted. my eyes were glued to the screen the whole time, and in 2d! as for the spider confusion, let's just say since there are sequels to come, that certain characters are being set up and don't want to give too much away, so better left guessing, right?"
190,I believe we will find much more about Spider's motivation in additional scenes.
191,Literally this movie broke my mind. There are some shots that are literally impossible. They're real. I cannot deny that they're real.
192,The most beautiful film that my eyes have seen. It was breathtakingly gorgeous. Bravo.
193,"The thing about these movies, is there are so many new elements, ideas, creatures, fauna, biology, and visuals that adding in a complex story is going to be too much. Keeping the story grounded in familiarity allows them to go crazy with everything else without risk of losing the audience. I think we also live in a time where people are too hard to please and are very cynical. The director is like, ‚ÄúLook at this major masterful achievement we made with this movie!‚Äú and people are like, ‚ÄúMeh, looks nice.‚Äù"
194,The explanation on the way of water gave me straight chills
195,James Cameron: the king of great sequels 
196,"Last it last night, loved it. They should keep the hangout sequences going forward."
197,"This movie is a testament to how, when used correctly, CGI can blow your mind. Take something fantastical in nature, and make it look fantastical."
198,I saw the movie today and Chris‚Äôs words here are very accurate. I give this movie a 7/10. 
199,"What I find really odd is the fact that O.G Star Wars is praised by so many, but the story in those films, is also incredibly simple. Big budget movies (Nolan, Reeves and Villeneuve are the big exceptions that comes to mind) are generally better off following simple plots and focusing on atmosphere, character interplay, set pieces and so on. I really like that Chris brings that up because a lot of critics specifically use it to ding the Avatar series but not fellow blockbuster films like Top Gun: Maverick, Mad Max: Fury Road."
200,Cameron really sow his two most popular movies and combined them in the final act of this movie
201,"can hardly believe we finally arrived at the sequel after all this time, and I'm so happy it delivered "
202,Thank you Chris so so much for this video  I thought Avatar part 2 was the absolute most amazing visual movie i've ever seen!!!! Top gun Maverick and Avatar 2 - best movies of the year ü´∂
203,"I think it was a great sequel probably better than the original especially with the characters (the children). However, My only weird gripe is that it felt like there could just be MORE. Like when you take over 13 years to make a sequel and spend that time touting your brilliance you raise expectations a lot. And when a movie is 3+ hours long there shouldn't be anything left by the wayside or underwhelming. I felt certain storylines went nowhere in 3 hours (the romance between the daughter and one of jake's son), the random female military general who shows up at the beginning and gets totally forgotten about by the end of the film. Why tf was Weaver's character pregnant and by who and how was she able to deliver a baby after she was SHOT and KILLED lol."
204,"Don't be too hard on Spider. 

Remember, we have three more sequels to flesh out that character."
205,"First of all I didn't even felt those 3 hours passing. I was so much into the movie...watched it at 18th of december and I keep thinking about it. I wanna watch it again and again. But what makes me think are my worries...people are so disappointed for some reason, and I'm scared we won't get our avatar 3,4 and 5...the story has just begon people. They just showd us the inside of the planet. Showed new characters. New places. All the new facts. It's just getting started"
206,"The word ""bro"" managed to sneak itself thousands of years into the future. They should've just cut out the kids to keep saying ""bro"" all the time. There too many avatar kids involved. Really wanted to see jakes story evolve. Wanted to know more about their ""Eywa"" and hints of origins. The original was just as good..."
207,I think the 4 hour cut that‚Äôll inevitably be released will help us feel more attached to the characters
208,"One of the very few movies worth watching this year.  Since 2020, Hollywood pretty much died.   I remember in 2019 we went to the theatres pretty much every week and some weeks we had to make a choice on what movie we wanted to watch because more than one looked interesting.  This year I think this is the 4th movie I watched.  Very different world.  Also on the premiere night, there was about 80 people in the theatre to watch Avatar 2... same thing happened with Top Gun Maveric, there was like 20 people in the theatre on release night... I don't understand how they can finance these behemoths of movie with no one going to see them !   As for the movie itself, to me it was perfect.  There is not a single bad thing I can say about it.   To me it's a 9/10.  If it was the first movie of the series it would be 10/10.   I had no issues at all with Spider's decisions.   First he was forced to help the humans after being tortured.  Then he decided to save the guy from drowning because he saved his life a few moments before."
209,"The story of rescuing your father from the belly of the whale.  Jake Sully‚Äôs kid does it, and Spider tried to with his ‚Äúdad‚Äù being an asshole (human version) and also an Avatar asshole.  

When spider was with the military avatars and they were on their own, he had fun training.  But he definitely knew right from wrong once they tried to hunt down Jake."
210,Just finished watching it in 4D. It made the experience so much better.
211,"I saw the movie yesterday, and while I was indeed a little ""meh"" about the story, I gotta say it really grew on me with the duration of that movie. I have read some critics going on how visually bland this movie is. And I'm sorry, but it is anything but visually bland. It is a vibrant, beautiful world that feels very natural. I think it is also important to see the story not only movie by movie, but as a whole. And while it wasn't as grand for me personally as the first one, I will not only definitely watch it again in cinema, but I'm also greatly looking forward to the next one, that hopefully will drop."
212,"Without spoiling...
The part you mentioned in the middle that makes you want to get back at these people, was really hard to watch.
I get it. But I also think as good as a message it is about saving our oceans for our kids, it may be a little traumatizing for them to see."
213,"James Cameron's interview lately said that Kiri will be the main key character in Avatar's saga and as a Huge fan of Sigourney Weaver, nothing more exciting than this news. I knew that James admire her since their first-time movie Aliens that he wanted to recast her back to Avatar 2 and turn her into the main key character for the upcoming series.....can't wait for this."
214,"I just saw this last night.  For the entire evening after viewing this movie I felt emotionally elevated. It was all I could talk about until my spouse and I went to bed. However,  in the morning is when it hit me that the  story line was a little too  'Disney-ish' in theme. Also, the constant cursing really got on my nerves.  It seemed to cheapen the movie in my opinion,  to have the same nemesis from the first film basically rise from the dead all so he could  go after the Scully yet again. But what really had me upset after thinking about it, was that the sequel ended with the open-ended possibility that the same 'evil' guy could come back and   do the chase for yet a 3rd time. Considering the millions of dollars, the sheet amount of time and the number of people who participated in creating such a beautiful film I felt more effort should have put into developing a brand new story line verses  continuing the same old one that frankly most of us have seen many times before in several movies prior to this one.  Anyway, great film I just wish they put more into the plot."
215,"I was very impressed by Avatar 2. At the risk of being hyperbolic: The 3D and the visuals were phenomenal and were close to photoreal, the action was spectacular, and the score was great. I had faith in Cameron as something of a Cameron fanboy since childhood (I'm now 40) and he did not disappoint as usual. I don't normally see movies more than once in the theatre but would have no problem watching it again in 3-D, and recommend seeing it in that format if people have the chance."
216,"This entire time I was sitting there watching the movie thinking that James Cameron's deep sea dive that he did
Must have really impacted him.
And I also get hardcore subnautica vibes."
217,"I watched it today and really enjoyed the film. From a visual standpoint it's jaw dropping. You'd think that we're used to good CGI in 2022 (and most of us are definitely tired of 3D), but man, this is just on another level. 
The story is simple, yes, but it's also effective. The characters are well flashed-out (yes, except for Spider, I suppose), it's all well acted, the dialog is simple but just feels natural within the world of Pandora. The emotions absolutely worked for me  from the start, and yes, when I watched that intense scene about halfway through I just kept on thinking ""Those humans need to die."" Plus, Na'vi are just damn sexy."
218,the weird thing is that a motive is that we need to protect our planet. but the budget for this movie could save so many lives
219,"It is the single most amazing cinematic experience in the history of film.

10/10 and the hype for Avatar 3 is immeasurable."
220,"Kept whispering to my girlfriend how amazing the cgi in every scene.


Also. When navi mom, went blue widow, blue knight of vengeance was insane."
221,This is the first movie I‚Äôve ever walked out on. Went to the bathroom at the halfway mark and I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to go back and sit through another 90 minutes of it.
222,"I think we have to comment on how Sigourney Weaver's senior voice was used in a teenage girl's character.. 
All in all though. Visually stunning film!"
223,I though Spider as a character made more sense for Cameron to put it there. He symbolizes our current generation who sees through the brutality of our past generation and wanted to protect it but also had some emotional attachment to their past generation and what they have achieved might not have been done if they didn't do it the same way.
224,One of the best movies this year!! In my top 5 movies of 2022!
225,"Not seen it yet, but I really look forward to go see this with my father. I was 9 years old when he brought me to see the first one. It's gonna feel special."
226,"I believe that we're not supposed to understand that character's motivation, because he himself does not understand his motivation.  That's the whole point of the character.  If this movie were a standalone that would be quite a problem, but we have more movies coming down the pipe, all with storylines set in stone from before first filming.  This character has a lot of room for development and with any luck at all, he won't get JJ-Abrams'd into a dead end."
227,"i just saw the movie and i wanted to say something about spider. unlike what most people are saying, i do understand his motivations for the most part. At the beginning of the movie theres a scene where spider is playing with the Sully children, and neytiri says to jake that he should ""be with his own kind"". i do wish they expanded upon neytiris opinions on spider a bit more throughout the movie, but i think this scene is fine for the most part. later you can see spider being afraid of neytiri and trying to hide from her during the first scene where the Sullys are escaping the recons, and again during the final battle. furthermore, spider was not raised with a proper father and felt more of an 'outcast', so when he met his 'real father' i cant blame him for being conflicted on who to trust. I think all of those reasons reinforce his indecisiveness on who to side with, along with him caring deeply for his adoptive family and the people who raised him. it's obvious that hes not a perfect character, nor his motivations, but hopefully when the movie comes out on dvd there will be deleted scenes to fill in the blanks."
228,I imagined the sky people(us humans) invading again being much more epic and scary but maybe Cameron is saving that for the future films.
229,"I was never really excited to see the movie but my friends insisted for us to watch it. I'm surprised. I liked it. It's not the most complicated plot but the way the story was told reminds of the old movies. The build up of emotion was excellent. I mean, isn't this the main whole thing about movies - for us to get entertained and I was. The only thing that takes me away some times are the 'rapid zoom in/out' IDK maybe I'm a boomer lol"
230,"While both Avatar films are fairly weak on plot, they are still some of my most favourite films ever, and definitely the best to watch at a cinema, it just didn't feel like a cash grab like 90% of releases lately. Loved it"
231,"This movie was great! Just watched it in 3D and holy shit, of course it looks beautiful but it looked AMAZING in 3D. I loved the action that was in the movie, which there is quite a bit more than I had thought there was going to be, and while the middle of the movie did drag a bit while introducing all of the new water stuff, it was much needed as a lot of what was introduced is used in some way shape or form by the end of the film."
232,"the part you mentioned how the character 'spider' is confusing & understand his motives. i believe that's intentionally how Cameron wanted to make it incomplete so that he will reveal it in avatar 3. the way i see it, Avatar 2 is just a build-up for 3. then the ultimate climax will be in Avatar 4 ending the franchise."
233,"I just watched it in IMAX 3D and hgeavily regret that, because the theather for some reason had a very low frame rate, definitely not even close to 60FPS which I expected to be a special feature of this movie. I'd take higher FPS over 3D any time. And btw, Spider's motivation was a very very clear thing actually and his whole story line is very well done, you just didn't get it, it happens. Sometimes you need to watch the movie twice to get all the things in it. He wasn't flipping sides AT ALL, not sure where you got that from. {spoiler} He was hostaged and forced to do certain things, there was no choice at that point."
234,"*Potential Spoilers*

Spider did feel like a weird character, but he is in quite a complicated situation, wouldn't you say? He gets to be with his father, but loves the Na'Vi. His father isn't actually his father, but clearly shows some form of caring for him. He's just a torn up character."
235,Spot on regarding Spider. Still seeing this in IMAX 3D is just so amazing.
236,"Totally Agree!!!
Avatar: The Way Of Water and Top Gun: Maverick are Masterpieces "
237,Everything has been done before and James knows this which is why he focuses more on presentation and less on story with each of his films. I think he's at the stage in his life where he'd like to create more meaningful films and he found that meaning within Avatar. He has earned the right to create something that's all his own while investing all his time into that creation.
238,I was bought too much into the story and the rescue part of the story was like emotional torture for me
239,"I loved this movie, and on the note for Spider, he reminded me of Theon a bit from GOT (except more likeable). He seems lost and looking for his place in the world / in a family."
240,"I heard the movie had a climate change doomsday agenda so I have not watched it. The way you described it, it doesn't sound so bad. Obviously we need to protect our oceans. Ô∏è I loved the first, so I night watch it now. Great review!"
241,I wish you would add chapters/timestamps to stuff like the rating you give. I haven't watched it yet but I always know what to expect based on your ratings but I didnt want to risk spoilers.
242,anyone has any thoughts on the language used during the movie? i thought its absolutely strange that the metkayina ppl are capable of english just like the omatikaya ppl... i mean its understandable that the omatikaya can speak english since grace was mediated to the tribe as an english teacher in the previous movie but there was no such context for metkayna being able to speak english in the wow. i love avatar and am so excited for the upcoming ones but this was one thing that bothered me while watching the wow.
243,"I was one of the cynical ""it's too late, nobody cares about avatar anymore"" people too but hearing all of the positive responses has actually made me really excited to see it"
244,The way of water was so good. I felt like swimming after the movie
245,"Chris, there are THREE movies that blew my mind this year - Everything, Everywhere All At Once, Top Gun Maverick and Avatar The Way of Water."
246,"Just returned from the theatre, that was just Amazing, if you haven‚Äôt sent in it in IMAX i can only say ‚Äúrun fools‚Äù:)"
247,"I watched it tonight with my girls....(8 and 9)
 They loved it. And I thought it was way way better then the first movie.  Even though a I missed a half hour of it standing in line for food."
248,"I think the Spider story line is left open deliberately - he has many options in the future films, including some kind of ""Anakin Skywalker"" line. It's no secret that the Avatar sequels are planned at least til part 5 as of now"
249,"I just saw this movie en 4DX and man, what a masterpiece. Perhaps the plot is not the most original, but the soul of the movie itself, is just glorious to watch. So many emotions mixed up and the visuals are the best I have seen in my life. Cameron did a great job in bringing us back to Pandora and hating humans yet again, bravo!"
250,"I left the movie pleased with what Cameron and his team delivered.

That should be the only thing that matters as a moviegoer. "
251,"I just watched it last night in 3D and it was just mind blowing. I thought that 3+ hours would be really tiring, but it really doesn‚Äôt feel like 3+ hours‚Ä¶ I wanted more. I will agree with you about the Spider character, there were many times during the movie that I was thinking, why is he telling them that?? (the bad guys). He didn‚Äôt betray his friends, but why was he giving out so much information about how to blend in with the Na‚Äô vi people??"
252,"See I preferred the first one because it ""pops"" more in 3d being in forests and jungles colorful vibrant almost claustrophobic at times but that whole film culminating in the climactic battle for pandora pays off by expelling the ""bad humans"" from earth off of Pandora The whole thing ties up nice and neatly in a bow, but you know earth wasn't gonna let that golden goose get away."
253,"Some thoughts I had watching this movie:
- the story was better than the first 
- I could hang out with the Na‚Äôvi and just appreciate the visuals even without a story
- the pure attention to detail to everything that was designed in the film"
254,"I must admit I was hoping James Cameron was going to push the technology further with this movie. I was hoping he would put out at least, a VR experience of Pandora from arriving from space, to forrest to oceans. Or even a way to watch the movie in VR some how that you have almost a 360 view."
255,"I saw this in 3D and it was fantastic, but I'm really looking forward to seeing it a second time in Dolby digital, because I feel that's the superior way to view films now. I love the character of Spider, btw. Kiri and Spider are my favorite characters and I think they were really well written. I think Spider will play a larger role in the next film, and I'm curious where Kiri's story will go."
256,"Not seen this yet , looking forward to watching it tho , but I just feel like it‚Äôs going to be like watching a computer game cut scene made for the computer addicted youth of today"
257,Just the thought of what the directors brain can imagine and have the ability to bring it to life
258,"So.. Avatar 2. Starting with the soundtrack, Simon Franglen mixed up his creation with James Horner‚Äôs ‚ÄúAvatar 1‚Äù  music elements and pushed to a classical side. It‚Äôs almost like putting on a fully prepared original Italian pizza some extra Cheddar cheese. Combined with some visual moments, where things and live creatures are falling from the sinking ship, it all reminded ‚Äú Titanic‚Äù, which Cameron probably felt nostalgic about and has turned the story to slightly happier ending."
259,"very beautiful looking move, would defo recommend seeing it in theatres while you can. I very much enjoyed it but my 2 critiques are the same as what chris was saying about spider as well as the FPS swapping between shots was a bit jarring and taken me out of some of the action scenes for a second or two : )"
260,"I give major props to the storytelling in this movie. While all the main characters a great and are pretty fleshed out, I never thought I'd get emotionally invested the most in the redemption arc of giant CGI space whale."
261,"I had very little hype for this movie so my expectations weren‚Äôt very high, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was far better than I expected and I thoroughly enjoyed it"
262,"Yeah the reason spider kept goign back and forth is because he is constantly tugged between loyalty to his friends, his father, and lack of fitting in he was struggling with."
263,"unfortunately the AMC i watched this film at had dropped the ball and had a crooked projector, so the screen wasn't properly aligned and somewhat blurry. I'll have to watch it again at a different theater to get the full experience, but from what I could see, it was a spectacular showcase of visual effects and had some pretty cool characters that i felt attached to. excited for the rewatch."
264,I left the theatres wanting to see more of the Water World!!
265,"After watching reviews of this movie, I can't wait for the 4K Blu-Ray to come out so I can watch all the beautiful visuals on my OLED tv. The first one already looks awesome on a normal blu-ray disc. Can't imagine how this 2nd one will look like."
266,"I was in the theatres and I was like to my brother, this movie is amazing but it's halfway and I don't know what's it about, then 2mins later, I was like ""ohhhh, oh my god, they are wh.... ...ters!"". And the movie doesn't let up afterwards. I got Spider's motivation from the scene inside the facility with the other kids but your points of him being wishy-washy are on point, that ending was like a big set up and middle finger"
267,The movie was incredible.  Stunning in every frame. 5 stars. Must watch. Will watch it again
268,"Simple is best. I think a lot of people are still not ready for the Avatar universe. And after more than a decade of only seeing superhero movies in theaters, I think Avatar was the best thing that could happen to Cinema. It is also a very important film from a spiritual and environmental aspect made in Hollywood (New Zealand)."
269,agreed the story is very simple but a lot of people think that a simple story is a bad story and I don't really agree with that. Everyone has their opinions but to me it is still very entertaining and immersive.
270,Spectacular movie....i could watch it 10 Times
271,"I agree with this review.  The first half meanders a bit, but it was always beautiful to watch and a few people were crying by the end."
272,Although many people criticized it even the 45 min long underwater sequence was mind-blowing. Just seeing the relationship between the whale type creature and at the avatars was amazing.
273,"Saw this movie in the High Frame Rate version and wow. Just wow, the movie looked so real. The water scenes were so damn unbelievable."
274,"I saw this on Friday and the whole time I was watching it, I thought to myself 'Wow, this is a good movie'."
275,It is available in 2D via Dolby Cinema at AMC Burbank 16. That‚Äôs how I watched it‚Äôd and it was just as jaw dropping.
276,"I think they had to force spider in there for the ending, in order to be able to keep it going to #3. Since he alone could have essentially stopped it if he didn‚Äôt do you know what at the end."
277,A Father Protects his Family‚Ä¶. AMAZING 
278,"i love how much you really get to know and care and get attached to the characters. that mixed with the visuals makes the simple plot work, i loved it"
279,Chris always knows how to cut through the hype and stay levelheaded
280,I loved Spider and his plot line
281, Much anticipated. It has been over 10 years. Cannot wait to see this 
282,The underwater scenes feel like they come from the future of CGI
283,This movie was as good or even better than the first movie. It is must watch. So much better than any marvel/DC comic movies that came out the last couple years. This is definitely refreshing.
284,Imagine if James Cameron was in charge of the next Star Wars trilogy....
285,I think what i apreciate about your reviews is you have a love for the craft of filmmaking and even if a movie doesnt have the best script or dialog you still show love for the exceptional craft involved
286,Spider's role is that he has the perspective of being neutral between the naavi and humans. He has the potential to be a villain but also the potential to remain with the naavi. He grew up with the navy but also had time to bond with his dad. He wanted to be a naavi but he is just a human. Etc...
287,Avatar way of water is so much better than the first and I cried at the end 
288,Here is a hot take....this movie will not break even.
289,"AVATAR always looked awesome in 3D because it was shot from the ground up with stereoscopic cameras, so 3D technology has always been in its core. 

The films that piggybacked on Avatar‚Äôs 3D tech success were shot with regular super 35 or IMAX cameras and a 3D pseudo process was added in post making them look silly and not real 3D at all. It was a gimmick that allowed Hollywood and theatres to charge extra on tickets for ‚Äúthe 3D experience‚Äù when it truly was not."
290,Honestly I love the Avatar movies
291,"I read Avatar Highground Comics, which was made from James Cameron's original script for Avatar 2. The comic helped me understand Jake's Family and each of their quirky personalities. I even understood Spider's motivation from that comic and why he is bitter at times."
292,Just saw it. It's so worth going to the cinema to see it!
293,My only gripe with the film is its runtime  could  have been trimmed  a bit . Watched it at 4DX was an experience.  Cameron is a master story teller no matter  what the story  is .
294,"I thought it was very emotional, and I loved it."
295,For the first time in my life I felt like I was not paying enough to watch a movie.
296,"I just finished the movie with my dad and my brother, and in my opinion, I loved the movie. For me, it does a lot of things that the first movie did but just way better. My biggest problem with the first movie was that it felt too generic. Even the action scenes, I was like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs cool I guess‚Äù. In short, I didn‚Äôt care about anything but I did like enough to see the Avatar 2. And the second movie blew my expectations. I actually gave a sh*t about the characters, the last hour was amazing, I was on the edge of my seat. I loved the family dynamic and the message about family and appreciating the Ocean was done very well, it SHOWED you the message not tell you it. I can see a kid Watching this movie and feeling like to improve on something or appreciate something that they didn‚Äôt before. Now I didn‚Äôt mind the kids doing dumb stuff because it felt realistic to me. Here‚Äôs the thing, kids always do/repeat dumb stuff. I think the reason why Kids repeat the same problem is because they want to prove something and throw experience they learned that they were wrong about it. Really my only problem with the movie was the stuff dealing with Spider‚Äôs character, not bad but felt out of place for me. All in all I just really loved Avatar 2. Im just going to say it right now, I would rather see this movie again than Top Gun: Maverick or The Batman. It has a message that is very relatable and important for younger people and I just cared a lot for the character. It did have its problems but I don‚Äôt care honestly. In my opinion, what matters in a movie is what it does best or what the creator was trying to achieve, not trying to do everything perfectly, i hope that makes sense."
297,The visuals are as astonishing as you could ever imagine (or not) but personally I would've hoped for more ambiguous moments and complex charakters which probably would have led to a more surprising and deeper storyline
298,"okay my thoughts... I loved the movie, I really liked that there was less of the military than before... in this film there was basically one big ship and one small boat... and I think that was enough... I liked the idea of the general having a blue avatar clone with his memories.. that was okay to me, but what I thought is far fetched that he had a son (spider)... that's like too much for me "
299,I think that a lot of what happens with Spider will become more important in the sequel. I do agree that his characterisation is a bit odd though
300,Way of the water was fantastic being a father definitely hit hard awesome movie
301,"I and my wife watched it in the theatres and we were like ‚ÄúDamm, we‚Äôve never seen anything like it‚Äù. What I really loved this movie was how James Cameron used this platform to convey a message."
302,Saw it last night in 3D. Awesome movie.
303,I'm totally in. Part of filmmaking is visual art. I agree with the simple story in Avatar. But the technology used to film it! It was BEAUTIFUL to experience it in 3D. That's the only reason I've waiting for Avatar 2 for so many years. Is art in movement at its best. If the story is entertaining to say the minimum it worths the ticket to watch something unique. And see you at the Oscars. I bet on it.
304,"This movie blew me away and is a masterpiece of film making! My only gripe is the frame rate issues in certain scenes which

lacks visual continuity."
305,"I haven't sat through your entire video, but we as a family LOVED IT. I was being told all the negative things by some of the people I watch on utube. I love family movie."
306,This movie was made with true craftsmanship which is really rare nowadays. Just appreciate it man and don‚Äôt over analyze it.
307,Spider as a character wasn't executed very well. I understand that spider is wishy washy. But the character is a young teenager who is in a rough situation. He doesn't know what to be. Thankfully his screen presence is limited to being a vehicle for the villain. He doesn't bring the movie down.
308,"I saw it Saturday In IMAX 3-D
It was AMAZING  I was so upset I had to get up to pee halfway through "
309,"Having seen the film myself, I think it's interesting the complaint you had about Spider. I think if you think about it, the exact same complaint could be made about the character Jack (Peter's son) in the movie Hook, which I know you think is an A+ movie. I think what you're missing with Spider is he's just a kid who wasn't really raised by anyone, and as such is somewhat open to easy manipulation. "
310,I personally absolutely loved this movie
311,"saw  it last day in 3d mode . Science fiction movie with great message of protecting our nature, forest and ocean."
312,"Simple story is an understatement. I liked the movie, there was a lot of good character building and the visuals are amazing, but after three hours it left me with an empty feeling as the main plotline can be plainly summarized as 'bad guy wants revenge for first movie, but he fails again'"
313,I watched it in 2D on Thursday and it was amazing!
314,"Watched it today and I genuinely didn't think that Spider's actions were random, was paying close attention to his scenes and thought they made a little bit of sense. Movie's pretty good, but Film struggles with pacing"
315,"The thing for me about Avatar is that I expect it to be gorgeous and impressive to look at. It's not fair of me to just expect that as a given thing, but that's just how I feel, but I watched Into the Spider-verse a thousand times and it looks gorgeous AND has a great story, a simple one, but told in a spectacular way. Avatar always felt like a tech demo to me, I will watch that movie and I guess I will be blown away by the way it looks, but if the story is as regular as the one of the first movie, I won't love it. That's a shame, Cameron is a great filmmaker and I would love to see him achieve more than just ""yeah it looks amazing"""
316,"The thing with simple storues is there is nothing bad about them, they are perfectly fine, they work and they entertain and they carry a message."
317,3D has been out for Over 30 years as far as I know maybe earlier. I can't believe it's progressed so slowly!
318,"I've just watched it and for me the weakest aspect of the movie is how the topic of parenting and family is portrayed. I felt like I was watching a movie from the Fifties. Also I had the feeling they rewrote a good chunk of the script mid-way because there are a couple of scenes that don't make much sense. But I went in the theater for a rollercoaster ride, not for a good story, and I wasn't disappointed in the least"
319,I watch it in 2d and I love it. It's so beautiful.
320,I saw it in 2D in a theater all by myself. I was perfectly fine not seeing it in 3D. 8.8/10. Better than the first Avatar.
321,"Chris, don't know if you read these messages, but you bring such joy to those that see your reviews. Nice that this is trending #7, you so rightly deserve it. Stay well! Nice job & can't wait to see it in the theater!"
322,Saw it in Imax 3D at 48 FPS and wow what an experience

329,"From Academy Award¬Æ winning director James Cameron comes Avatar, the story of an ex-Marine who finds himself thrust into hostilities on an alien planet filled with exotic life forms. As an Avatar, a human mind in an alien body, he finds himself torn between two worlds, in a desperate fight for his own survival and that of the indigenous people."
